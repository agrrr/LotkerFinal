-+<i>It's a good target.</i>
-+
-+22
-+00:03:33,965 --> 00:03:36,092
-+There's an ATM on the

-+
-+23
-+00:03:36,259 --> 00:03:37,302
-+Cameras.

-+Means our guy doesn't

-+
-+27
-+00:03:43,516 --> 00:03:45,602

-+<i>It's also bulletproof,</i>
-+
-+31
-+00:03:51,024 --> 00:03:52,275
-+<i>which means private security...</i>
-+
-+32
-+00:03:52,358 --> 00:03:53,776
-+<i>which means more guns...</i>
-+
-+33
-+00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:56,446
-+<i>which means more headaches
-+for somebody. Probably us.</i>
-+
-+34
-+00:03:56,529 --> 00:03:59,032
-+You guys know
-+I can move things with my mind, right?
-+
-+35
-+00:03:59,407 --> 00:04:01,910
-+Looking over your shoulder
-+needs to become second nature.
-+
-+36
-+00:04:02,452 --> 00:04:04,829
-+Anybody ever tell you
-+you're a little paranoid?
-+
-+37
-+00:04:04,913 --> 00:04:07,206
-+<i>Not to my face.
-+Why? Did you hear something?</i>
-+
-+38
-+00:04:07,332 --> 00:04:08,499
-+<i>Eyes on target, folks.</i>
-+
-+39
-+00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:10,251
-+This is the best lead
-+we've had on Rumlow
-+
-+40
-+00:04:10,335 --> 00:04:11,544
-+in six months. I don't want to lose him.
-+
-+41
-+00:04:11,794 --> 00:04:14,088
-+If he sees us coming,
-+that won't be a problem.
-+
-+42
-+00:04:14,172 --> 00:04:15,506
-+He kind of hates us.
-+
-+43

-+Sam...
-+
-+44
-+00:04:20,428 --> 00:04:21,846
-+see that garbage truck?
-+
-+45
-+00:04:22,013 --> 00:04:23,222
-+Tag it.
-+
-+46
-+00:04:41,783 --> 00:04:42,867
-+Give me X-ray.
-+
-+47
-+00:04:48,039 --> 00:04:49,707
-+That truck's loaded for max weight.
-+
-+48
-+00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:50,875
-+And the driver's armed.
-+
-+49
-+00:04:51,042 --> 00:04:52,043
-+It's a battering ram.
-+
-+50
-+00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:53,211
-+<i>- Go now.</i>
-+- What?
-+
-+51
-+00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,588
-+He's not hitting the police.
-+
-+52
-+00:05:59,819 --> 00:06:01,738
-+Body armour, AR-15s.
-+
-+53
-+00:06:01,946 --> 00:06:03,489
-+<i>I make seven hostiles.</i>
-+
-+54
-+00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:13,666
-+I make five.
-+
-+55
-+00:06:18,379 --> 00:06:20,173
-+Sam.
-+
-+56
-+00:06:23,718 --> 00:06:24,802
-+Four.
-+
-+57
-+00:06:29,307 --> 00:06:30,725
-+Rumlow's on the third floor.
-+
-+58
-+00:06:30,808 --> 00:06:32,185
-+Wanda, just like we practised.
-+
-+59
-+00:06:32,351 --> 00:06:33,352
-+What about the gas?
-+
-+60
-+00:06:33,478 --> 00:06:34,520
-+Get it out.
-+
-+61
-+00:06:52,497 --> 00:06:53,539
-+Pack it up.
-+
-+62
-+00:07:31,035 --> 00:07:32,120
-+He's here.
-+
-+63
-+00:07:35,957 --> 00:07:37,375
-+Rumlow has a biological weapon.
-+
-+64
-+00:07:37,542 --> 00:07:38,876
-+<i>I'm on it.</i>
-+
-+65
-+00:08:14,078 --> 00:08:15,913
-+I don't work like that no more.
-+
-+66
-+00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:20,084
-+Fire in the hole.
-+
-+67
-+00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:26,632
-+No!
-+
-+68
-+00:08:49,572 --> 00:08:50,615
-+Sam.
-+
-+69
-+00:08:50,823 --> 00:08:52,950
-+<i>He's in an AFV heading north.</i>
-+
-+70
-+00:08:57,622 --> 00:08:59,624
-+Take this to the airstrip.
-+
-+71
-+00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:01,792
-+We're not gonna outrun them.
-+Lose the truck.
-+
-+72
-+00:09:09,217 --> 00:09:10,384
-+Where are you going to meet us?
-+
-+73
-+00:09:10,468 --> 00:09:11,969
-+I'm not.
-+
-+74
-+00:09:23,231 --> 00:09:25,024
-+I've got four, they're splitting up.
-+
-+75
-+00:09:29,904 --> 00:09:31,489
-+I got the two on the left.
-+
-+76
-+00:09:39,997 --> 00:09:41,207
-+They ditched their gear.
-+
-+77
-+00:09:41,374 --> 00:09:43,084
-+It's a shell game now.
-+One of them has the payload.
-+
-+78
-+00:09:49,257 --> 00:09:51,092
-+There you are, you son of a bitch.
-+
-+79
-+00:09:52,134 --> 00:09:53,427
-+I've been waiting for this.
-+
-+80
-+00:10:10,861 --> 00:10:12,029
-+He doesn't have it.
-+
-+81
-+00:10:12,488 --> 00:10:13,489
-+I'm empty!
-+
-+82
-+00:10:13,698 --> 00:10:14,949
-+Out of the way!
-+
-+83
-+00:10:54,405 --> 00:10:55,573
-+Drop it.
-+
-+84
-+00:10:55,948 --> 00:10:56,907
-+Or I'll drop this.
-+
-+85
-+00:10:58,743 --> 00:11:00,536
-+- Drop it!
-+- He'll do it!
-+
-+86
-+00:11:07,835 --> 00:11:09,754
-+Payload secure. Thanks, Sam.
-+
-+87
-+00:11:09,962 --> 00:11:10,921
-+Don't thank me.
-+
-+88
-+00:11:11,088 --> 00:11:12,673
-+I'm not thanking that thing.
-+
-+89
-+00:11:12,923 --> 00:11:13,924
-+His name is Redwing.
-+
-+90
-+00:11:14,091 --> 00:11:15,259
-+<i>I'm still not thanking it.</i>
-+
-+91
-+00:11:15,343 --> 00:11:16,427
-+He's cute. Go ahead, pet him.
-+
-+92
-+00:11:23,267 --> 00:11:24,268
-+Come on!
-+
-+93
-+00:11:32,485 --> 00:11:34,570
-+This is for dropping
-+a building on my face.
-+
-+94
-+00:11:52,838 --> 00:11:53,881
-+Ahh!
-+
-+95
-+00:11:56,842 --> 00:11:58,594
-+I think I look pretty good,
-+all things considered.
-+
-+96
-+00:11:58,803 --> 00:11:59,762
-+Who's your buyer?
-+
-+97
-+00:12:00,179 --> 00:12:01,972
-+You know, he knew you.
-+
-+98
-+00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:04,183
-+Your pal, your buddy, your Bucky.
-+
-+99
-+00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:06,769
-+What did you say?
-+
-+100
-+00:12:06,936 --> 00:12:08,646
-+He remembered you.
-+
-+101
-+00:12:09,146 --> 00:12:11,690
-+I was there. He got all weepy about it.
-+
-+102
-+00:12:13,192 --> 00:12:14,985
-+Till they put his brain back in a blender.
-+
-+103
-+00:12:15,903 --> 00:12:17,655
-+He wanted you to know something.
-+
-+104
-+00:12:17,738 --> 00:12:18,781
-+He said to me...
-+
-+105
-+00:12:19,323 --> 00:12:21,367
-+"Please tell Rogers.
-+
-+106
-+00:12:21,992 --> 00:12:23,244
-+"When you gotta go...
-+
-+107
-+00:12:23,452 --> 00:12:25,162
-+"you gotta go."
-+
-+108
-+00:12:27,498 --> 00:12:28,624
-+And you're coming with me.
-+
-+109
-+00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:47,268
-+Oh, my...
-+
-+110
-+00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,355
-+Sam...
-+
-+111
-+00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:54,483
-+we need Fire and Rescue
-+
-+112
-+00:12:54,567 --> 00:12:56,193
-+on the south side of the building.
-+
-+113
-+00:12:56,735 --> 00:12:58,279
-+We gotta get up there.
-+
-+114
-+00:13:05,161 --> 00:13:11,792
-+<i>Try to remember the kind of September</i>
-+
-+115
-+00:13:11,876 --> 00:13:15,629
-+<i>When grass was green</i>
-+
-+116
-+00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:19,049
-+Wake up, dear,
-+and say goodbye to your father.
-+
-+117
-+00:13:19,216 --> 00:13:20,843
-+Who's the homeless person
-+on the couch?
-+
-+118
-+00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:24,388
-+This is why
-+I love coming home for Christmas...
-+
-+119
-+00:13:24,555 --> 00:13:25,806
-+right before you leave town.
-+
-+120
-+00:13:25,973 --> 00:13:28,225
-+Be nice, dear,
-+he's been studying abroad.
-+
-+121
-+00:13:28,392 --> 00:13:30,227
-+Really? Which broad?
-+What's her name?
-+
-+122
-+00:13:30,394 --> 00:13:31,729
-+Candice.
-+
-+123
-+00:13:32,229 --> 00:13:33,314
-+Do me a favour?
-+
-+124
-+00:13:33,397 --> 00:13:34,899
-+Try not to burn
-+the house down before Monday.
-+
-+125
-+00:13:35,065 --> 00:13:36,233
-+Okay, so it's Monday.
-+
-+126
-+00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,568
-+That is good to know,
-+
-+127
-+00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:39,570
-+I will plan my toga party accordingly.
-+
-+128
-+00:13:40,321 --> 00:13:41,405
-+Where you going?
-+
-+129
-+00:13:41,572 --> 00:13:42,656
-+Your father's flying us
-+
-+130
-+00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:44,074
-+to the Bahamas for a little getaway.
-+
-+131
-+00:13:44,241 --> 00:13:45,743
-+We might have to make a quick stop.
-+
-+132
-+00:13:45,826 --> 00:13:47,995
-+At the Pentagon. Right?
-+
-+133
-+00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:51,165
-+Don't worry, you're gonna love
-+the holiday menu at the commissary.
-+
-+134
-+00:13:51,248 --> 00:13:54,001
-+They say sarcasm
-+is a metric for potential.
-+
-+135
-+00:13:54,084 --> 00:13:56,003
-+If that's true,
-+you'll be a great man someday.
-+
-+136
-+00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:57,505
-+I'll get the bags.
-+
-+137
-+00:13:59,965 --> 00:14:02,343
-+He does miss you when you're not here.
-+
-+138
-+00:14:04,094 --> 00:14:07,431
-+And frankly, you're going to miss us.
-+
-+139
-+00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,850
-+Because this is the last time
-+
-+140
-+00:14:09,934 --> 00:14:11,519
-+we're all going to be together.
-+
-+141
-+00:14:12,436 --> 00:14:14,813
-+You know what's about to happen.
-+
-+142
-+00:14:15,356 --> 00:14:16,774
-+Say something.
-+
-+143
-+00:14:16,857 --> 00:14:18,943
-+If you don't, you'll regret it.
-+
-+144
-+00:14:22,613 --> 00:14:24,114
-+I love you, Dad.
-+
-+145
-+00:14:25,282 --> 00:14:27,535
-+And I know you did the best you could.
-+
-+146
-+00:14:43,384 --> 00:14:45,344
-+That's how I wish it happened.
-+
-+147
-+00:14:47,805 --> 00:14:50,391
-+Binarily Augmented Retro-Framing...
-+
-+148
-+00:14:50,474 --> 00:14:51,600
-+or BARF.
-+
-+149
-+00:14:51,684 --> 00:14:53,477
-+God, I gotta work on that acronym.
-+
-+150
-+00:14:53,561 --> 00:14:55,938
-+An extremely costly method
-+
-+151
-+00:14:56,021 --> 00:14:58,274
-+of hijacking the hippocampus...
-+
-+152
-+00:14:58,357 --> 00:15:02,486
-+to clear traumatic memories.
-+
-+153
-+00:15:05,155 --> 00:15:06,240
-+Huh.
-+
-+154
-+00:15:06,365 --> 00:15:07,575
-+It doesn't change the fact
-+
-+155
-+00:15:07,658 --> 00:15:09,493
-+that they never made it to the airport...
-+
-+156
-+00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,205
-+or all the things I did to avoid
-+processing my grief, but...
-+
-+157
-+00:15:15,165 --> 00:15:19,503
-+Plus, $611 million for my
-+little therapeutic experiment?
-+
-+158
-+00:15:21,505 --> 00:15:24,216
-+No one in their right mind
-+would've ever funded it.
-+
-+159
-+00:15:25,509 --> 00:15:28,053
-+Help me out,
-+what's the MIT mission statement?
-+
-+160
-+00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,471
-+"To generate, disseminate...
-+
-+161
-+00:15:30,848 --> 00:15:32,349
-+"and preserve knowledge.
-+
-+162
-+00:15:32,933 --> 00:15:34,602
-+"And work with others...
-+
-+163
-+00:15:34,685 --> 00:15:37,521
-+"to bring it to bear on
-+the world's great challenges."
-+
-+164
-+00:15:38,522 --> 00:15:41,275
-+Well, you are the others.
-+
-+165
-+00:15:42,526 --> 00:15:43,861
-+And, quiet as it's kept...
-+
-+166
-+00:15:43,944 --> 00:15:45,613
-+the challenges facing you
-+
-+167
-+00:15:45,696 --> 00:15:47,114
-+are the greatest mankind's ever known.
-+
-+168
-+00:15:47,531 --> 00:15:49,908
-+Plus, most of you are broke.
-+
-+169
-+00:15:50,034 --> 00:15:51,952
-+Oh, I'm sorry. Rather, you were.
-+
-+170
-+00:15:52,119 --> 00:15:53,370
-+As of this moment...
-+
-+171
-+00:15:53,537 --> 00:15:55,789
-+every student has been made
-+an equal recipient...
-+
-+172
-+00:15:55,873 --> 00:15:58,876
-+of the inaugural
-+September Foundation Grant.
-+
-+173
-+00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:00,461
-+As in...
-+
-+174
-+00:16:00,878 --> 00:16:03,464
-+all of your projects have
-+just been approved and funded.
-+
-+175
-+00:16:06,717 --> 00:16:09,303
-+No strings, no taxes...
-+
-+176
-+00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:11,639
-+just reframe the future!
-+
-+177
-+00:16:11,805 --> 00:16:13,474
-+Starting now.
-+
-+178
-+00:16:23,317 --> 00:16:24,318
-+Go break some eggs.
-+
-+179
-+00:16:32,076 --> 00:16:33,786
-+Wow. Wow.
-+
-+180
-+00:16:35,412 --> 00:16:37,581
-+That took my breath away.
-+
-+181
-+00:16:37,748 --> 00:16:39,166
-+Oh, Tony! So generous.
-+
-+182
-+00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:41,502
-+So much money! Wow!
-+
-+183
-+00:16:41,669 --> 00:16:43,420
-+Out of curiosity...
-+
-+184
-+00:16:43,587 --> 00:16:46,382
-+will any portion of that grant
-+be made available to faculty?
-+
-+185
-+00:16:46,465 --> 00:16:47,841
-+I know, "Ooh, gross," but hear me out.
-+
-+186
-+00:16:47,925 --> 00:16:50,177
-+I have got this killer idea
-+for a self-cooking hotdog.
-+
-+187
-+00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,345
-+Basically,
-+chemical detonator embedded...
-+
-+188
-+00:16:51,428 --> 00:16:52,388
-+Restroom's this way, yeah?
-+
-+189
-+00:16:52,471 --> 00:16:53,597
-+Yeah. Embedded in the meat shaft.
-+
-+190
-+00:16:53,681 --> 00:16:56,016
-+Mr Stark, I am so sorry
-+about the teleprompter.
-+
-+191
-+00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,518
-+I didn't know Miss Potts had cancelled.
-+
-+192
-+00:16:57,601 --> 00:16:59,353
-+They didn't have time to fix it.
-+
-+193
-+00:17:00,979 --> 00:17:02,940
-+It's fine. I'll be right back.
-+
-+194
-+00:17:03,273 --> 00:17:04,441
-+We'll catch up later.
-+
-+195
-+00:17:22,626 --> 00:17:25,462
-+That was nice,
-+what you did for those young people.
-+
-+196
-+00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:27,631
-+Ah, they deserve it.
-+
-+197
-+00:17:27,798 --> 00:17:29,967
-+Plus, it helps ease my conscience.
-+
-+198
-+00:17:30,551 --> 00:17:35,139
-+They say there's a correlation
-+between generosity and guilt.
-+
-+199
-+00:17:36,223 --> 00:17:38,809
-+But if you've got the money...
-+
-+200
-+00:17:39,685 --> 00:17:41,812
-+break as many eggs as you like.
-+
-+201
-+00:17:42,563 --> 00:17:43,939
-+Right?
-+
-+202
-+00:17:52,698 --> 00:17:53,532
-+Are you going up?
-+
-+203
-+00:17:54,158 --> 00:17:56,201
-+I'm right where I want to be.
-+
-+204
-+00:17:56,869 --> 00:17:58,078
-+Okay. Hey.
-+
-+205
-+00:18:01,331 --> 00:18:04,042
-+Sorry, it's an occupational hazard.
-+
-+206
-+00:18:04,334 --> 00:18:05,878
-+I work for the State Department.
-+
-+207
-+00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:08,338
-+Human Resources.
-+
-+208
-+00:18:08,839 --> 00:18:10,591
-+I know it's boring...
-+
-+209
-+00:18:10,924 --> 00:18:14,178
-+but it enabled me to raise a son.
-+
-+210
-+00:18:15,012 --> 00:18:17,931
-+I'm very proud of what he grew up to be.
-+
-+211
-+00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:22,519
-+His name was Charlie Spencer.
-+
-+212
-+00:18:24,897 --> 00:18:26,023
-+You murdered him.
-+
-+213
-+00:18:27,691 --> 00:18:29,276
-+In Sokovia.
-+
-+214
-+00:18:31,028 --> 00:18:34,114
-+Not that that matters in the least to you.
-+
-+215
-+00:18:35,783 --> 00:18:37,910
-+You think you fight for us?
-+
-+216
-+00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:41,371
-+You just fight for yourself.
-+
-+217
-+00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:46,043
-+Who's going to avenge my son, Stark?
-+
-+218
-+00:18:47,628 --> 00:18:49,213
-+He's dead...
-+
-+219
-+00:18:49,463 --> 00:18:51,548
-+and I blame you.
-+
-+220
-+00:19:00,098 --> 00:19:01,308
-+<i>11 Wakandans were</i>

-+<i>The traditionally reclusive Wakandans</i>
-+

-+<i>were on an outreach mission...</i>

-+
-+229
-+00:19:20,077 --> 00:19:23,914
-+<i>but by the indifference
-+of those pledged to stop them.</i>

-+230

-+<i>Victory at the expense of the innocent...</i>
-+
-+231

-+<i>is no victory at all.</i>

-+<i>They are operating outside</i>

-+<i>and above the international law.</i>
-+
-+235

-+That's not true.
-+
-+242

-+Turn the TV back on.
-+
-+243
-+00:19:51,692 --> 00:19:53,735
-+They're being very specific.
-+
-+244

-+00:19:58,615 --> 00:20:00,158
-+Rumlow said "Bucky"...
-+
-+246
-+00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:03,495
-+and all of a sudden
-+I was a 16-year-old kid again,
-+
-+247
-+00:20:03,579 --> 00:20:04,621
-+in Brooklyn.
-+
-+248
-+00:20:08,876 --> 00:20:10,460
-+And people died.
-+
-+249
-+00:20:12,504 --> 00:20:13,505
-+It's on me.
-+
-+250
-+00:20:14,298 --> 00:20:15,966
-+It's on both of us.
-+
-+251
-+00:20:17,009 --> 00:20:18,385
-+This job...
-+
-+252
-+00:20:21,305 --> 00:20:23,223
-+We try to save
-+as many people as we can.
-+
-+253
-+00:20:24,224 --> 00:20:25,893
-+Sometimes that doesn't
-+mean everybody.
-+
-+254
-+00:20:26,018 --> 00:20:27,978
-+But if we can't find a way
-+to live with that...
-+
-+255
-+00:20:28,145 --> 00:20:30,063
-+then next time...
-+
-+256
-+00:20:31,356 --> 00:20:33,150
-+maybe nobody gets saved.
-+
-+257
-+00:20:37,404 --> 00:20:39,406
-+Vis! We talked about this.
-+
-+258
-+00:20:39,489 --> 00:20:42,200
-+Yes, but the door was open
-+so I assumed that...
-+
-+259
-+00:20:43,952 --> 00:20:46,914
-+Captain Rogers wished to know
-+when Mr Stark was arriving.
-+
-+260
-+00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,540
-+Thank you. We'll be right down.
-+
-+261
-+00:20:49,082 --> 00:20:51,251
-+I'll use the door.
-+
-+262
-+00:20:52,252 --> 00:20:54,588
-+Oh, and apparently,
-+he's brought a guest.
-+
-+263
-+00:20:54,755 --> 00:20:56,465
-+We know who it is?
-+
-+264
-+00:20:56,632 --> 00:20:58,467
-+The Secretary of State.
-+
-+265
-+00:21:01,595 --> 00:21:03,180
-+<i>Five years ago...</i>
-+
-+266
-+00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,432
-+I had a heart attack...
-+
-+267
-+00:21:05,724 --> 00:21:08,769
-+and dropped right in
-+the middle of my backswing.
-+
-+268
-+00:21:09,561 --> 00:21:11,980
-+Turned out it was the best
-+round of my life...
-+
-+269
-+00:21:12,147 --> 00:21:14,274
-+because after 13 hours of surgery
-+
-+270
-+00:21:14,358 --> 00:21:16,151
-+and a triple bypass...
-+
-+271
-+00:21:17,069 --> 00:21:20,822
-+I found something 40 years
-+in the Army had never taught me.
-+
-+272
-+00:21:21,531 --> 00:21:22,699
-+Perspective.
-+
-+273
-+00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:28,789
-+The world owes the Avengers
-+an unpayable debt.
-+
-+274
-+00:21:29,623 --> 00:21:32,542
-+You have fought for us...
-+
-+275
-+00:21:32,793 --> 00:21:35,837
-+protected us, risked your lives...
-+
-+276
-+00:21:36,421 --> 00:21:40,133
-+but while a great many people
-+see you as heroes...
-+
-+277
-+00:21:40,217 --> 00:21:42,219
-+there are some...
-+
-+278
-+00:21:43,595 --> 00:21:45,555
-+who would prefer the word "vigilantes."
-+
-+279
-+00:21:45,681 --> 00:21:47,975
-+What word would you use,
-+Mr Secretary?
-+
-+280
-+00:21:48,141 --> 00:21:49,351
-+How about "dangerous"?
-+
-+281
-+00:21:50,102 --> 00:21:52,813
-+What would you call
-+a group of US-based,
-+
-+282
-+00:21:52,896 --> 00:21:55,023
-+enhanced individuals...
-+
-+283
-+00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:58,151
-+who routinely ignore
-+sovereign borders...
-+
-+284
-+00:21:58,318 --> 00:22:01,947
-+and inflict their will
-+wherever they choose...
-+
-+285
-+00:22:02,114 --> 00:22:04,241
-+and who, frankly, seem unconcerned
-+
-+286
-+00:22:04,324 --> 00:22:05,575
-+about what they leave behind?
-+
-+287
-+00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:12,165
-+New York.
-+
-+288
-+00:22:25,971 --> 00:22:27,723
-+Washington, D.C.
-+
-+289
-+00:22:35,897 --> 00:22:37,315
-+Sokovia.
-+
-+290
-+00:22:48,201 --> 00:22:49,077
-+Lagos.
-+
-+291
-+00:22:58,545 --> 00:23:00,172
-+Okay. That's enough.
-+
-+292
-+00:23:02,382 --> 00:23:03,467
-+For the past four years,
-+
-+293
-+00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:04,885
-+you've operated with unlimited power...
-+
-+294
-+00:23:05,052 --> 00:23:06,803
-+and no supervision.
-+
-+295
-+00:23:07,054 --> 00:23:08,847
-+That's an arrangement
-+the governments of the world
-+
-+296
-+00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:10,932
-+can no longer tolerate.
-+
-+297
-+00:23:13,393 --> 00:23:15,812
-+But I think we have a solution.
-+
-+298
-+00:23:19,566 --> 00:23:21,902
-+The Sokovia Accords.
-+
-+299
-+00:23:22,569 --> 00:23:25,197
-+Approved by 117 countries...
-+
-+300
-+00:23:25,363 --> 00:23:28,241
-+it states that the Avengers
-+
-+301
-+00:23:28,325 --> 00:23:30,786
-+shall no longer be a private organisation.
-+
-+302
-+00:23:30,994 --> 00:23:32,204
-+Instead...
-+
-+303
-+00:23:32,454 --> 00:23:34,581
-+they'll operate under the supervision
-+
-+304
-+00:23:34,664 --> 00:23:36,583
-+of a United Nations panel...
-+
-+305
-+00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:41,088
-+only when and if that panel
-+deems it necessary.
-+
-+306
-+00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:45,258
-+The Avengers were formed to
-+make the world a safer place.
-+
-+307
-+00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:46,968
-+I feel we've done that.
-+
-+308
-+00:23:47,344 --> 00:23:51,139
-+Tell me, Captain, do you know
-+where Thor and Banner are right now?
-+
-+309
-+00:23:52,808 --> 00:23:54,935
-+If I misplaced a couple of
-+30 megaton nukes...
-+
-+310
-+00:23:55,227 --> 00:23:57,437
-+you can bet there'd be consequences.
-+
-+311
-+00:23:57,938 --> 00:24:02,150
-+Compromise. Reassurance.
-+That's how the world works.
-+
-+312
-+00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,362
-+Believe me, this is the middle ground.
-+
-+313
-+00:24:06,321 --> 00:24:08,907
-+So, there are contingencies.
-+
-+314
-+00:24:09,366 --> 00:24:12,035
-+Three days from now,
-+the UN meets in Vienna...
-+
-+315
-+00:24:12,202 --> 00:24:14,204
-+to ratify the Accords.
-+
-+316
-+00:24:16,373 --> 00:24:17,958
-+Talk it over.
-+
-+317
-+00:24:21,128 --> 00:24:23,296
-+And if we come
-+to a decision you don't like?
-+
-+318
-+00:24:25,257 --> 00:24:26,842
-+Then you retire.
-+
-+319
-+00:24:50,073 --> 00:24:51,074
-+Hello?
-+
-+320
-+00:24:52,951 --> 00:24:55,036
-+Is this your car out front?
-+
-+321
-+00:24:56,621 --> 00:24:58,415
-+I jumped the kerb.
-+
-+322
-+00:25:00,041 --> 00:25:01,042
-+Maybe we could...
-+
-+323
-+00:25:01,626 --> 00:25:03,170
-+take care of it ourselves.
-+
-+324
-+00:25:03,336 --> 00:25:05,380
-+If you wanna call the cops,
-+that's okay, too...
-+
-+325
-+00:25:05,547 --> 00:25:06,965
-+- I guess.
-+- No.
-+
-+326
-+00:25:08,633 --> 00:25:10,427
-+No cops.
-+
-+327
-+00:25:10,677 --> 00:25:11,553
-+Thank you.
-+
-+328
-+00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:51,426
-+You have kept your looks, Colonel.
-+
-+329
-+00:25:52,052 --> 00:25:53,053
-+Congratulations.
-+
-+330
-+00:25:57,140 --> 00:26:01,144
-+"Mission report. December 16, 1991."
-+
-+331
-+00:26:01,311 --> 00:26:02,771
-+Who are you?
-+
-+332
-+00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:05,815
-+My name is Zemo.
-+
-+333
-+00:26:06,983 --> 00:26:09,194
-+I will repeat my question.
-+
-+334
-+00:26:09,819 --> 00:26:14,699
-+Mission report, December 16, 1991.
-+
-+335
-+00:26:14,866 --> 00:26:16,660
-+How did you find me?
-+
-+336
-+00:26:16,826 --> 00:26:18,787
-+When S.H.I.E.L.D. fell...
-+
-+337
-+00:26:18,954 --> 00:26:22,415
-+Black Widow released
-+HYDRA files to the public.
-+
-+338
-+00:26:22,582 --> 00:26:25,252
-+Millions of pages. Much of it encrypted.
-+
-+339
-+00:26:25,335 --> 00:26:27,045
-+Not easy to decipher.
-+
-+340
-+00:26:30,382 --> 00:26:32,259
-+But, I have experience.
-+
-+341
-+00:26:33,134 --> 00:26:34,761
-+And patience.
-+
-+342
-+00:26:36,137 --> 00:26:38,181
-+A man can do anything if he has those.
-+
-+343
-+00:26:39,307 --> 00:26:40,433
-+What do you want?
-+
-+344
-+00:26:41,685 --> 00:26:43,561
-+Mission report.
-+
-+345
-+00:26:43,728 --> 00:26:45,563
-+December 16.
-+
-+346
-+00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:47,148
-+1991.
-+
-+347
-+00:26:47,899 --> 00:26:51,319
-+Go... to... hell!
-+
-+348
-+00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,836
-+HYDRA deserves its place
-+on the ash heap.
-+
-+349
-+00:27:08,461 --> 00:27:10,922
-+So your death would not bother me.
-+
-+350
-+00:27:11,548 --> 00:27:13,508
-+But I'd have to use this book...
-+
-+351
-+00:27:13,967 --> 00:27:17,178
-+and other bloodier methods
-+to find what I need.
-+
-+352
-+00:27:17,345 --> 00:27:19,556
-+I don't look forward to that.
-+
-+353
-+00:27:21,141 --> 00:27:23,351
-+You'd only be dying for...
-+
-+354
-+00:27:23,518 --> 00:27:24,894
-+your pride.
-+
-+355
-+00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:42,203
-+Hail HYDRA.
-+
-+356
-+00:27:53,548 --> 00:27:56,009
-+Secretary Ross has
-+a Congressional Medal of Honour...
-+
-+357
-+00:27:56,092 --> 00:27:57,260
-+which is one more than you have.
-+
-+358
-+00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:59,179
-+So let's say we agree to this thing.
-+
-+359
-+00:27:59,262 --> 00:28:01,097
-+How long is it gonna be
-+before they LoJack us
-+
-+360
-+00:28:01,181 --> 00:28:02,474
-+like a bunch of common criminals?
-+
-+361
-+00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,684
-+117 countries want to sign this.
-+
-+362
-+00:28:04,768 --> 00:28:07,520
-+117, Sam, and you're just like,
-+"No, that's cool. We got it."
-+
-+363
-+00:28:07,604 --> 00:28:08,688
-+How long are you going
-+to play both sides?
-+
-+364
-+00:28:08,772 --> 00:28:09,939
-+I have an equation.
-+
-+365
-+00:28:10,106 --> 00:28:11,983
-+Oh, this will clear it up.
-+
-+366
-+00:28:12,525 --> 00:28:14,110
-+In the eight years since Mr Stark
-+
-+367
-+00:28:14,194 --> 00:28:15,653
-+announced himself as Iron Man...
-+
-+368
-+00:28:15,737 --> 00:28:19,199
-+the number of known enhanced persons
-+has grown exponentially.
-+
-+369
-+00:28:20,909 --> 00:28:22,202
-+During the same period...
-+
-+370
-+00:28:22,369 --> 00:28:24,496
-+the number of potentially
-+world-ending events
-+
-+371
-+00:28:24,579 --> 00:28:26,122
-+has risen at a commensurate rate.
-+
-+372
-+00:28:26,331 --> 00:28:27,582
-+Are you saying it's our fault?
-+
-+373
-+00:28:27,999 --> 00:28:30,460
-+I'm saying there may be a causality.
-+
-+374
-+00:28:32,462 --> 00:28:35,215
-+Our very strength invites challenge.
-+
-+375
-+00:28:35,298 --> 00:28:37,926
-+Challenge incites conflict.
-+
-+376
-+00:28:38,093 --> 00:28:39,886
-+And conflict...
-+
-+377
-+00:28:41,429 --> 00:28:43,681
-+breeds catastrophe.
-+
-+378
-+00:28:43,807 --> 00:28:45,225
-+Oversight...
-+
-+379
-+00:28:47,644 --> 00:28:50,563
-+Oversight is not an idea that
-+can be dismissed out of hand.
-+
-+380
-+00:28:50,814 --> 00:28:51,815
-+Boom.
-+
-+381
-+00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:53,900
-+Tony.
-+
-+382
-+00:28:54,067 --> 00:28:56,694
-+You are being uncharacteristically
-+non-hyperverbal.
-+
-+383
-+00:28:56,861 --> 00:28:57,987
-+It's because he's already
-+made up his mind.
-+
-+384
-+00:28:58,238 --> 00:29:00,115
-+Boy, you know me so well.
-+
-+385
-+00:29:01,116 --> 00:29:03,618
-+Actually, I'm nursing
-+an electromagnetic headache.
-+
-+386
-+00:29:04,494 --> 00:29:07,288
-+That's what's going on, Cap.
-+It's just pain.
-+
-+387
-+00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:09,958
-+It's discomfort.
-+
-+388
-+00:29:10,041 --> 00:29:12,043
-+Who's putting coffee grounds
-+in the disposal?
-+
-+389
-+00:29:12,877 --> 00:29:15,505
-+Am I running a bed and breakfast
-+for a biker gang?
-+
-+390
-+00:29:21,761 --> 00:29:23,388
-+Oh, that's Charles Spencer, by the way.
-+
-+391
-+00:29:23,471 --> 00:29:24,889
-+He's a great kid.
-+
-+392
-+00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:28,435
-+Computer engineering degree,
-+3.6 GPA...
-+
-+393
-+00:29:28,643 --> 00:29:31,187
-+had a floor-level gig
-+at Intel planned for the fall.
-+
-+394
-+00:29:31,438 --> 00:29:33,773
-+But first, he wanted to put
-+a few miles on his soul...
-+
-+395
-+00:29:34,149 --> 00:29:36,651
-+before he parked it
-+behind a desk. See the world.
-+
-+396
-+00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:38,319
-+Maybe be of service.
-+
-+397
-+00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:40,488
-+Charlie didn't want to go to Vegas or
-+
-+398
-+00:29:40,572 --> 00:29:42,031
-+Fort Lauderdale,
-+which is what I would do.
-+
-+399
-+00:29:42,115 --> 00:29:44,826
-+He didn't go to Paris or Amsterdam,
-+which sounds fun.
-+
-+400
-+00:29:44,993 --> 00:29:46,953
-+He decided to spend his summer
-+
-+401
-+00:29:47,036 --> 00:29:48,538
-+building sustainable housing
-+for the poor.
-+
-+402
-+00:29:48,621 --> 00:29:50,123
-+Guess where. Sokovia.
-+
-+403
-+00:29:54,002 --> 00:29:55,253
-+He wanted to make
-+a difference, I suppose.
-+
-+404
-+00:29:55,503 --> 00:29:56,796
-+We won't know because we dropped
-+
-+405
-+00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,007
-+a building on him
-+while we were kicking ass.
-+
-+406
-+00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:09,893
-+There's no decision-making
-+process here.
-+
-+407
-+00:30:11,603 --> 00:30:12,770
-+We need to be put in check!
-+
-+408
-+00:30:13,062 --> 00:30:15,440
-+Whatever form that takes, I'm game.
-+
-+409
-+00:30:15,607 --> 00:30:16,649
-+If we can't accept limitations,
-+
-+410
-+00:30:16,733 --> 00:30:17,775
-+if we're boundary-less...
-+
-+411
-+00:30:17,859 --> 00:30:19,986
-+we're no better than the bad guys.
-+
-+412
-+00:30:20,069 --> 00:30:22,572
-+Tony, someone dies on your watch,
-+you don't give up.
-+
-+413
-+00:30:22,864 --> 00:30:23,531
-+Who said we're giving up?
-+
-+414
-+00:30:23,615 --> 00:30:26,201
-+We are if we're not
-+taking responsibility for our actions.
-+
-+415
-+00:30:26,367 --> 00:30:28,161
-+This document just shifts the blame.
-+
-+416
-+00:30:28,328 --> 00:30:29,996
-+I'm sorry, Steve.
-+
-+417
-+00:30:30,163 --> 00:30:31,748
-+That is dangerously arrogant.
-+
-+418
-+00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,042
-+This is the United Nations
-+we're talking about.
-+
-+419
-+00:30:34,125 --> 00:30:36,419
-+It's not the World Security Council,
-+
-+420
-+00:30:36,503 --> 00:30:37,754
-+it's not S.H.I.E.L.D., it's not HYDRA.
-+
-+421
-+00:30:37,921 --> 00:30:39,214
-+No, but it's run by people
-+
-+422
-+00:30:39,297 --> 00:30:40,673
-+with agendas, and agendas change.
-+
-+423
-+00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,675
-+That's good. That's why I'm here.
-+
-+424
-+00:30:42,759 --> 00:30:45,345
-+When I realised what my weapons
-+were capable of in the wrong hands...
-+
-+425
-+00:30:45,428 --> 00:30:46,930
-+I shut it down
-+and stopped manufacturing.
-+
-+426
-+00:30:47,263 --> 00:30:49,516
-+Tony, you chose to do that.
-+
-+427
-+00:30:49,599 --> 00:30:52,519
-+If we sign this, we surrender
-+our right to choose.
-+
-+428
-+00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,855
-+What if this panel sends us somewhere
-+we don't think we should go?
-+
-+429
-+00:30:56,022 --> 00:30:57,357
-+What if there is somewhere
-+we need to go
-+
-+430
-+00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,441
-+and they don't let us?
-+
-+431
-+00:30:58,691 --> 00:31:00,193
-+We may not be perfect,
-+
-+432
-+00:31:00,276 --> 00:31:01,986
-+but the safest hands are still our own.
-+
-+433
-+00:31:02,153 --> 00:31:04,572
-+If we don't do this now,
-+
-+434
-+00:31:04,656 --> 00:31:06,324
-+it's gonna be done to us later.
-+
-+435
-+00:31:06,491 --> 00:31:08,409
-+That's the fact. That won't be pretty.
-+
-+436
-+00:31:08,576 --> 00:31:09,744
-+You're saying they'll come for me.
-+
-+437
-+00:31:09,827 --> 00:31:11,204
-+We would protect you.
-+
-+438
-+00:31:11,287 --> 00:31:13,081
-+Maybe Tony's right.
-+
-+439
-+00:31:14,374 --> 00:31:16,751
-+If we have one hand on the wheel,
-+
-+440
-+00:31:16,834 --> 00:31:18,920
-+we can still steer. If we take it off...
-+
-+441
-+00:31:19,003 --> 00:31:20,713
-+Aren't you the same woman
-+who told the government
-+
-+442
-+00:31:20,797 --> 00:31:22,257
-+to kiss her ass a few years ago?
-+
-+443
-+00:31:22,382 --> 00:31:24,717
-+I'm just reading the terrain.
-+
-+444
-+00:31:25,009 --> 00:31:28,179
-+We have made some
-+very public mistakes.
-+
-+445
-+00:31:28,346 --> 00:31:30,390
-+We need to win their trust back.
-+
-+446
-+00:31:30,557 --> 00:31:32,684
-+Focus up. I'm sorry.
-+Did I just mishear you...
-+
-+447
-+00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:34,811
-+- or did you agree with me?
-+- I want to take it back now.
-+
-+448
-+00:31:34,978 --> 00:31:35,812
-+No, you can't retract it.
-+
-+449
-+00:31:36,062 --> 00:31:37,063
-+Thank you. Unprecedented.
-+
-+450
-+00:31:38,731 --> 00:31:41,442
-+Okay. Case closed. I win.
-+
-+451
-+00:31:42,819 --> 00:31:43,987
-+I have to go.
-+
-+452
-+00:32:26,195 --> 00:32:29,741
-+And now, I would like
-+to invite Sharon Carter
-+
-+453
-+00:32:29,824 --> 00:32:31,409
-+to come up and say a few words.
-+
-+454
-+00:32:45,089 --> 00:32:48,301
-+Margaret Carter was known to most
-+as a founder of S.H.I.E.L.D...
-+
-+455
-+00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:51,346
-+but I just knew her as Aunt Peggy.
-+
-+456
-+00:32:53,723 --> 00:32:55,558
-+She had a photograph in her office.
-+
-+457
-+00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:58,853
-+Aunt Peggy standing next to JFK.
-+
-+458
-+00:32:59,812 --> 00:33:01,564
-+As a kid, that was pretty cool.
-+
-+459
-+00:33:01,856 --> 00:33:04,233
-+But it was a lot to live up to.
-+
-+460
-+00:33:04,442 --> 00:33:06,736
-+Which is why I never told
-+anyone we were related.
-+
-+461
-+00:33:08,154 --> 00:33:10,281
-+I asked her once how she managed
-+
-+462
-+00:33:10,365 --> 00:33:12,241
-+to master diplomacy and espionage...
-+
-+463
-+00:33:12,408 --> 00:33:16,746
-+in a time when no one wanted to see
-+a woman succeed at either.
-+
-+464
-+00:33:17,246 --> 00:33:19,082
-+She said, compromise where you can.
-+
-+465
-+00:33:19,999 --> 00:33:23,211
-+But where you can't, don't.
-+
-+466
-+00:33:24,128 --> 00:33:29,634
-+Even if everyone is telling you
-+that something wrong is something right.
-+
-+467
-+00:33:29,801 --> 00:33:33,054
-+Even if the whole world
-+is telling you to move...
-+
-+468
-+00:33:33,137 --> 00:33:36,849
-+it is your duty to plant
-+yourself like a tree...
-+
-+469
-+00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:41,521
-+look them in the eye and say
-+"No, you move."
-+
-+470
-+00:33:53,241 --> 00:33:55,368
-+When I came out of the ice,
-+
-+471
-+00:33:55,451 --> 00:33:57,829
-+I thought everyone
-+I had known was gone.
-+
-+472
-+00:33:58,579 --> 00:34:00,707
-+Then I found out she was alive.
-+
-+473
-+00:34:01,749 --> 00:34:03,292
-+I was just lucky to have her.
-+
-+474
-+00:34:03,918 --> 00:34:05,253
-+She had you back, too.
-+
-+475
-+00:34:07,839 --> 00:34:09,173
-+Who else signed?
-+
-+476
-+00:34:10,049 --> 00:34:12,844
-+Tony, Rhodey, Vision.
-+
-+477
-+00:34:13,761 --> 00:34:14,762
-+Clint?
-+
-+478
-+00:34:15,555 --> 00:34:17,140
-+Says he's retired.
-+
-+479
-+00:34:17,348 --> 00:34:19,142
-+- Wanda?
-+- TBD.
-+
-+480
-+00:34:20,768 --> 00:34:23,479
-+I'm off to Vienna
-+for the signing of the Accords.
-+
-+481
-+00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:25,273
-+There's plenty of room on the jet.
-+
-+482
-+00:34:29,152 --> 00:34:31,988
-+Just because it's the path
-+of least resistance...
-+
-+483
-+00:34:32,155 --> 00:34:34,365
-+doesn't mean it's the wrong path.
-+
-+484
-+00:34:34,615 --> 00:34:37,410
-+Staying together is more important
-+than how we stay together.
-+
-+485
-+00:34:38,286 --> 00:34:40,413
-+What are we giving up to do it?
-+
-+486
-+00:34:44,625 --> 00:34:45,877
-+I'm sorry, Nat.
-+
-+487
-+00:34:46,127 --> 00:34:47,795
-+I can't sign it.
-+
-+488
-+00:34:49,213 --> 00:34:50,214
-+I know.
-+
-+489
-+00:34:52,633 --> 00:34:54,051
-+Then what are you doing here?
-+
-+490
-+00:34:56,888 --> 00:34:59,182
-+I didn't want you to be alone.
-+
-+491
-+00:35:05,938 --> 00:35:07,148
-+Come here.
-+
-+492
-+00:35:12,695 --> 00:35:15,615
-+<i>At a special
-+United Nations conference...</i>
-+
-+493
-+00:35:15,698 --> 00:35:18,242
-+<i>117 countries have come together</i>
-+
-+494
-+00:35:18,367 --> 00:35:21,037
-+<i>to ratify the Sokovia Accords.</i>
-+
-+495
-+00:35:25,041 --> 00:35:26,501
-+Excuse me, Ms Romanoff?
-+
-+496
-+00:35:26,584 --> 00:35:28,211
-+- Yes?
-+- These need your signature.
-+
-+497
-+00:35:29,879 --> 00:35:31,214
-+- Thank you.
-+- Thanks.
-+
-+498
-+00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:35,718
-+I suppose neither of us
-+is used to the spotlight.
-+
-+499
-+00:35:37,094 --> 00:35:39,055
-+Oh, well, it's not always so flattering.
-+
-+500
-+00:35:39,305 --> 00:35:41,557
-+You seem to be doing all right so far.
-+
-+501
-+00:35:42,099 --> 00:35:44,060
-+Considering your last trip
-+to Capitol Hill...
-+
-+502
-+00:35:44,644 --> 00:35:48,147
-+I wouldn't think you'd be particularly
-+comfortable in this company.
-+
-+503
-+00:35:48,231 --> 00:35:49,357
-+Well, I'm not.
-+
-+504
-+00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:52,276
-+And that alone makes me glad
-+you are here, Ms Romanoff.
-+
-+505
-+00:35:52,443 --> 00:35:54,237
-+Why? You don't approve of all this?
-+
-+506
-+00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:57,657
-+The Accords, yes.
-+The politics, not really.
-+
-+507
-+00:35:58,157 --> 00:36:01,577
-+Two people in a room can get
-+more done than a hundred.
-+
-+508
-+00:36:01,744 --> 00:36:04,080
-+Unless you need to move a piano.
-+
-+509
-+00:36:06,624 --> 00:36:07,667
-+Ms Romanoff.
-+
-+510
-+00:36:07,834 --> 00:36:08,876
-+King T'Chaka.
-+
-+511
-+00:36:09,502 --> 00:36:11,754
-+Please, allow me to apologise
-+for what happened in Nigeria.
-+
-+512
-+00:36:11,921 --> 00:36:13,464
-+Thank you.
-+
-+513
-+00:36:13,631 --> 00:36:15,842
-+Thank you for agreeing to all of this.
-+
-+514
-+00:36:16,133 --> 00:36:19,262
-+I'm sad to hear that Captain Rogers
-+will not be joining us today.
-+
-+515
-+00:36:19,512 --> 00:36:20,721
-+Yes, so am I.
-+
-+516
-+00:36:20,888 --> 00:36:22,348
-+<i>If everyone could please be seated.</i>
-+

-+<i>This assembly is now in session.</i>
-+
-+518
-+00:36:25,101 --> 00:36:26,269
-+That is the future calling.
-+
-+519
-+00:36:28,104 --> 00:36:29,230
-+Such a pleasure.
-+
-+520
-+00:36:29,438 --> 00:36:30,606
-+Thank you.
-+
-+521
-+00:36:31,941 --> 00:36:35,653
-+For a man
-+who disapproves of diplomacy,
-+
-+522
-+00:36:36,362 --> 00:36:38,281
-+you're getting quite good at it.
-+
-+523
-+00:36:38,865 --> 00:36:40,449
-+I'm happy, Father.
-+
-+524
-+00:36:45,454 --> 00:36:46,205
-+Thank you.
-+
-+525
-+00:36:47,164 --> 00:36:48,082
-+Thank you.

-+<i>When stolen
-+Wakandan vibranium</i>

-+Those men and women
-+killed in Nigeria...
-+

-+were part of a goodwill mission
-+
-+531
-+00:37:03,431 --> 00:37:05,558
-+from a country too long in the shadows.
-+
-+532
-+00:37:06,767 --> 00:37:10,980
-+We will not, however,
-+let misfortune drive us back.
-+
-+533
-+00:37:11,063 --> 00:37:14,775
-+We will fight to improve
-+the world we wish to join.
-+
-+534
-+00:37:15,276 --> 00:37:19,030
-+I am grateful to the Avengers
-+for supporting this initiative.
-+
-+535
-+00:37:21,198 --> 00:37:23,284
-+Wakanda is proud
-+
-+536
-+00:37:23,367 --> 00:37:25,286
-+to extend its hand in peace.

-+but, um, not Aunt Peggy.
-+
-+540
-+00:38:06,118 --> 00:38:08,120
-+She bought me my first thigh holster.
-+
-+541
-+00:38:08,454 --> 00:38:10,164
-+Very practical.
-+
-+542
-+00:38:10,331 --> 00:38:11,707
-+And stylish.

-+544
-+00:38:19,882 --> 00:38:21,550
-+Berlin. Joint Terrorism Task Force.
-+
-+545
-+00:38:22,051 --> 00:38:23,886
-+Right. Right. Sounds fun.
-+
-+546
-+00:38:24,553 --> 00:38:26,013
-+I know, right?
-+
-+547
-+00:38:28,724 --> 00:38:31,060
-+I've been meaning to ask you.
-+
-+548
-+00:38:31,227 --> 00:38:34,146
-+When you were spying on me
-+from across the hall...
-+
-+549
-+00:38:34,397 --> 00:38:35,606
-+You mean when I was doing my job.
-+
-+550
-+00:38:38,609 --> 00:38:39,819
-+Did Peggy know?
-+
-+551
-+00:38:42,405 --> 00:38:44,365
-+She kept so many secrets.
-+
-+552
-+00:38:44,949 --> 00:38:46,575
-+I didn't want her to have one from you.
-+
-+553
-+00:38:51,122 --> 00:38:52,456
-+Thanks for walking me back.
-+
-+554
-+00:38:52,999 --> 00:38:54,208
-+Sure.
-+
-+555
-+00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:58,838
-+Steve.
-+
-+556
-+00:38:59,088 --> 00:39:00,715
-+There's something you gotta see.
-+
-+557
-+00:39:01,048 --> 00:39:02,758
-+<i>A bomb hidden in a news van...</i>
-+
-+558
-+00:39:02,925 --> 00:39:03,926
-+Who's coordinating?
-+
-+559
-+00:39:04,051 --> 00:39:05,011
-+<i>ripped through
-+the UN building in Vienna.</i>
-+
-+560
-+00:39:05,094 --> 00:39:06,178
-+Good. They're solid. Forensics?
-+
-+561
-+00:39:06,262 --> 00:39:07,263
-+<i>More than 70 people have been injured.</i>
-+
-+562
-+00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:11,225
-+<i>At least 12 are dead,
-+including Wakanda's King T'Chaka.</i>
-+
-+563
-+00:39:11,392 --> 00:39:13,185
-+<i>Officials have released
-+a video of a suspect...</i>
-+
-+564
-+00:39:13,352 --> 00:39:15,771
-+<i>who they have identified
-+as James Buchanan Barnes...</i>
-+
-+565
-+00:39:15,938 --> 00:39:17,356
-+<i>the Winter Soldier.</i>
-+
-+566
-+00:39:17,523 --> 00:39:18,941
-+<i>The infamous HYDRA agent...</i>
-+
-+567
-+00:39:19,108 --> 00:39:22,111
-+<i>linked to numerous acts of terrorism
-+and political assassinations.</i>
-+
-+568
-+00:39:22,278 --> 00:39:23,779
-+I have to go to work.
-+
-+569
-+00:39:29,535 --> 00:39:32,747
-+Call MI6, see if we can get
-+Micro Forensics to hurry this up.
-+
-+570
-+00:39:32,913 --> 00:39:34,123
-+We need the whole team
-+here in two hours
-+
-+571
-+00:39:34,206 --> 00:39:35,291
-+or it's not worth it.
-+
-+572
-+00:39:45,551 --> 00:39:46,719
-+I'm very sorry.
-+
-+573
-+00:39:53,726 --> 00:39:55,102
-+In my culture...
-+
-+574
-+00:39:55,311 --> 00:39:58,147
-+death is not the end.
-+
-+575
-+00:39:59,982 --> 00:40:03,027
-+It's more of a stepping-off point.
-+
-+576
-+00:40:04,195 --> 00:40:05,696
-+You reach out with both hands...
-+
-+577
-+00:40:05,988 --> 00:40:08,240
-+and Bast and Sekhmet,
-+
-+578
-+00:40:08,324 --> 00:40:10,910
-+they lead you into the green veldt...
-+
-+579
-+00:40:11,827 --> 00:40:13,871
-+where you can run forever.
-+
-+580
-+00:40:14,747 --> 00:40:16,415
-+That sounds very peaceful.
-+
-+581
-+00:40:17,917 --> 00:40:20,002
-+My father thought so.
-+
-+582
-+00:40:21,921 --> 00:40:24,006
-+I am not my father.
-+
-+583
-+00:40:24,131 --> 00:40:25,341
-+T'Challa...
-+
-+584
-+00:40:25,841 --> 00:40:28,344
-+Task Force will decide
-+who brings in Barnes.
-+
-+585
-+00:40:30,596 --> 00:40:32,723
-+Don't bother, Ms Romanoff.
-+
-+586
-+00:40:33,682 --> 00:40:35,267
-+I'll kill him myself.
-+
-+587
-+00:40:41,941 --> 00:40:42,942
-+Yeah?
-+
-+588
-+00:40:43,025 --> 00:40:44,276
-+You all right?
-+
-+589
-+00:40:44,443 --> 00:40:47,029
-+<i>Uh, yeah, thanks. I got lucky.</i>
-+
-+590
-+00:40:53,035 --> 00:40:56,622
-+I know how much Barnes
-+means to you. I really do.
-+
-+591
-+00:40:57,623 --> 00:41:00,626
-+Stay home. You'll only make this worse.
-+
-+592
-+00:41:00,876 --> 00:41:02,211
-+<i>For all of us.</i>
-+
-+593
-+00:41:02,503 --> 00:41:03,546
-+<i>Please.</i>
-+
-+594
-+00:41:03,671 --> 00:41:04,713
-+Are you saying you'll arrest me?
-+
-+595
-+00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,382
-+No.
-+
-+596
-+00:41:07,341 --> 00:41:08,384
-+Someone will.
-+
-+597
-+00:41:08,551 --> 00:41:10,761
-+<i>If you interfere.
-+That's how it works now.</i>
-+
-+598
-+00:41:10,970 --> 00:41:14,056
-+If he's this far gone, Nat,
-+I should be the one to bring him in.
-+
-+599
-+00:41:14,306 --> 00:41:15,391
-+<i>Why?</i>
-+
-+600
-+00:41:15,474 --> 00:41:17,893
-+Because I'm the one
-+least likely to die trying.
-+
-+601
-+00:41:19,979 --> 00:41:20,855
-+Shit.
-+
-+602
-+00:41:25,401 --> 00:41:27,236
-+She tell you to stay out of it?
-+
-+603
-+00:41:28,988 --> 00:41:29,989
-+Might have a point.
-+
-+604
-+00:41:30,156 --> 00:41:31,282
-+He'd do it for me.
-+
-+605
-+00:41:31,532 --> 00:41:32,950
-+1945, maybe.
-+
-+606
-+00:41:33,075 --> 00:41:35,828
-+I just want to make sure
-+we consider all our options.
-+
-+607
-+00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:37,496
-+The people that shoot at you
-+
-+608
-+00:41:37,705 --> 00:41:39,081
-+usually wind up shooting at me.
-+
-+609
-+00:41:41,667 --> 00:41:44,253
-+Tips have been pouring in
-+since that footage went public.
-+
-+610
-+00:41:44,461 --> 00:41:46,338
-+Everybody thinks
-+the Winter Soldier goes to their gym.
-+
-+611
-+00:41:46,922 --> 00:41:48,424
-+Most of it's noise.
-+
-+612
-+00:41:48,632 --> 00:41:49,925
-+Except for this.
-+
-+613
-+00:41:51,927 --> 00:41:54,263
-+My boss expects a briefing,
-+pretty much now...
-+
-+614
-+00:41:54,430 --> 00:41:56,599
-+so that's all the head start
-+you're gonna get.
-+
-+615
-+00:41:56,682 --> 00:41:57,766
-+Thank you.
-+
-+616
-+00:41:57,850 --> 00:41:59,602
-+You're gonna have to hurry.
-+
-+617
-+00:42:00,519 --> 00:42:02,229
-+We have orders to shoot on sight.
-+
-+618
-+00:42:08,444 --> 00:42:11,322
-+<i>Homecoming</i>
-+
-+619
-+00:42:12,990 --> 00:42:14,074
-+<i>One</i>
-+
-+620
-+00:42:14,617 --> 00:42:15,576
-+<i>One</i>
-+
-+621
-+00:42:20,664 --> 00:42:22,791
-+<i>Freight car</i>
-+
-+622
-+00:42:34,053 --> 00:42:35,971
-+I have your breakfast.
-+
-+623
-+00:42:39,683 --> 00:42:41,810
-+I could smell it before I opened the door.
-+
-+624
-+00:42:42,019 --> 00:42:43,854
-+Side of bacon and black coffee.
-+
-+625
-+00:42:44,021 --> 00:42:44,521
-+Again.
-+
-+626
-+00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:47,066
-+I can make you something different, if you like.
-+
-+627
-+00:42:47,191 --> 00:42:47,942
-+This is wonderful...
-+
-+628
-+00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:49,360
-+I will just put this on your...
-+
-+629
-+00:42:49,818 --> 00:42:51,403
-+It's okay, I can manage!
-+
-+630
-+00:44:24,747 --> 00:44:25,748
-+<i>Heads up, Cap.</i>
-+
-+631
-+00:44:25,914 --> 00:44:28,250
-+<i>German Special Forces,
-+approaching from the south.</i>
-+
-+632
-+00:44:29,043 --> 00:44:30,252
-+Understood.
-+
-+633
-+00:44:39,011 --> 00:44:39,928
-+Do you know me?
-+
-+634
-+00:44:42,890 --> 00:44:44,558
-+You're Steve.
-+
-+635
-+00:44:45,434 --> 00:44:47,686
-+I read about you in a museum.
-+
-+636
-+00:44:48,270 --> 00:44:50,022
-+<i>They've set the perimeter.</i>
-+
-+637
-+00:44:51,065 --> 00:44:52,608
-+I know you're nervous,
-+
-+638
-+00:44:52,691 --> 00:44:54,151
-+and you have plenty of reason to be.
-+
-+639
-+00:44:56,111 --> 00:44:57,488
-+But you're lying.
-+
-+640
-+00:44:58,739 --> 00:45:00,741
-+I wasn't in Vienna.
-+I don't do that any more.
-+
-+641
-+00:45:00,908 --> 00:45:02,076
-+<i>They're entering the building.</i>
-+
-+642
-+00:45:02,159 --> 00:45:04,745
-+Well, the people
-+who think you did are coming here now.
-+
-+643
-+00:45:04,870 --> 00:45:06,663
-+And they're not planning
-+on taking you alive.
-+
-+644
-+00:45:06,789 --> 00:45:08,290
-+That's smart.
-+
-+645
-+00:45:08,374 --> 00:45:09,583
-+Good strategy.
-+
-+646
-+00:45:11,251 --> 00:45:12,586
-+<i>They're on the roof. I'm compromised.</i>
-+
-+647
-+00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:17,466
-+This doesn't have to end in a fight, Buck.
-+
-+648
-+00:45:22,638 --> 00:45:24,640
-+- It always ends in a fight.
-+<i>- Five seconds.</i>
-+
-+649
-+00:45:25,641 --> 00:45:27,184
-+You pulled me from the river.
-+
-+650
-+00:45:27,810 --> 00:45:28,769
-+Why?
-+
-+651
-+00:45:29,812 --> 00:45:31,397
-+- I don't know.
-+<i>- Three seconds.</i>
-+
-+652
-+00:45:31,563 --> 00:45:33,148
-+Yes, you do.
-+
-+653
-+00:45:34,650 --> 00:45:35,734
-+<i>Breach! Breach! Breach!</i>
-+
-+654
-+00:45:56,296 --> 00:45:57,172
-+Buck, stop!
-+
-+655
-+00:45:57,923 --> 00:45:59,007
-+You're gonna kill someone.
-+
-+656
-+00:46:01,718 --> 00:46:03,053
-+I'm not gonna kill anyone.
-+
-+657
-+00:46:49,391 --> 00:46:50,934
-+Suspect has broken containment!
-+
-+658
-+00:46:51,268 --> 00:46:52,060
-+...he's headed down the east stairwell!
-+
-+659
-+00:47:03,530 --> 00:47:04,406
-+Come on, man.
-+
-+660
-+00:47:26,553 --> 00:47:27,554
-+Ahhh!
-+
-+661
-+00:48:09,555 --> 00:48:10,973
-+Sam, southwest rooftop.
-+
-+662
-+00:48:11,139 --> 00:48:12,432
-+<i>Who the hell's the other guy?</i>
-+
-+663
-+00:48:12,516 --> 00:48:13,767
-+About to find out.
-+
-+664
-+00:48:26,446 --> 00:48:28,240
-+- Sam.
-+<i>- Got him.</i>
-+
-+665
-+00:49:09,865 --> 00:49:11,241
-+<i>Stand down!</i>
-+
-+666
-+00:49:13,869 --> 00:49:14,870
-+<i>Stand down!</i>
-+
-+667
-+00:49:43,899 --> 00:49:45,400
-+Sam, I can't shake this guy.
-+
-+668
-+00:49:45,567 --> 00:49:46,735
-+Right behind you.
-+
-+669
-+00:51:21,830 --> 00:51:23,874
-+Stand down, now.
-+
-+670
-+00:51:31,006 --> 00:51:32,716
-+<i>Congratulations, Cap.</i>
-+
-+671
-+00:51:33,008 --> 00:51:34,634
-+<i>You're a criminal.</i>
-+
-+672
-+00:51:57,365 --> 00:51:58,575
-+<i>Your Highness.</i>
-+
-+673
-+00:52:04,790 --> 00:52:07,000
-+"A pinch of paprika."
-+
-+674
-+00:52:07,125 --> 00:52:08,126
-+A pinch.
-+
-+675
-+00:52:11,922 --> 00:52:13,799
-+Is that paprikash?
-+
-+676
-+00:52:13,924 --> 00:52:17,219
-+I thought it might lift your spirits.
-+
-+677
-+00:52:30,732 --> 00:52:32,734
-+Spirits lifted.
-+
-+678
-+00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:36,238
-+In my defence,
-+
-+679
-+00:52:36,321 --> 00:52:39,157
-+I haven't actually ever eaten
-+anything before, so...
-+
-+680
-+00:52:39,282 --> 00:52:40,492
-+May I?
-+
-+681
-+00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:41,451
-+Please.
-+
-+682
-+00:52:48,667 --> 00:52:49,918
-+- Wanda?
-+- Hmm.
-+
-+683
-+00:52:50,418 --> 00:52:52,045
-+No one dislikes you, Wanda.
-+
-+684
-+00:52:54,506 --> 00:52:55,465
-+Thanks.
-+
-+685
-+00:52:55,590 --> 00:52:56,633
-+Oh, you're welcome.
-+
-+686
-+00:52:56,842 --> 00:53:00,178
-+No, it's a involuntary response
-+in their amygdala.
-+
-+687
-+00:53:00,262 --> 00:53:02,389
-+They can't help but be afraid of you.
-+
-+688
-+00:53:02,556 --> 00:53:03,515
-+Are you?
-+
-+689
-+00:53:03,598 --> 00:53:05,392
-+My amygdala is synthetic, so...
-+
-+690
-+00:53:09,104 --> 00:53:12,274
-+I used to think of myself one way.
-+
-+691
-+00:53:13,942 --> 00:53:15,861
-+But after this...
-+
-+692
-+00:53:16,278 --> 00:53:18,446
-+I am something else.
-+
-+693
-+00:53:18,613 --> 00:53:22,117
-+I'm still me, I think, but...
-+
-+694
-+00:53:24,244 --> 00:53:26,913
-+that's not what everyone else sees.
-+
-+695
-+00:53:30,041 --> 00:53:32,002
-+Do you know, I don't know what this is?
-+
-+696
-+00:53:33,128 --> 00:53:34,129
-+Not really.
-+
-+697
-+00:53:34,629 --> 00:53:36,381
-+I know it's not of this world...
-+
-+698
-+00:53:36,590 --> 00:53:37,966
-+that it powered Loki's staff,
-+
-+699
-+00:53:38,091 --> 00:53:40,302
-+gave you your abilities, but...
-+
-+700
-+00:53:41,761 --> 00:53:44,973
-+its true nature is a mystery.
-+
-+701
-+00:53:45,265 --> 00:53:47,142
-+And yet, it is part of me.
-+
-+702
-+00:53:47,350 --> 00:53:48,476
-+Are you afraid of it?
-+
-+703
-+00:53:49,311 --> 00:53:51,646
-+I wish to understand it.
-+
-+704
-+00:53:51,813 --> 00:53:53,982
-+The more I do, the less it controls me.
-+
-+705
-+00:53:54,149 --> 00:53:57,068
-+One day... who knows?
-+
-+706
-+00:53:57,235 --> 00:53:58,486
-+I may even control it.
-+
-+707
-+00:54:01,197 --> 00:54:05,035
-+I don't know what's in this
-+but it is not paprika.
-+
-+708
-+00:54:05,827 --> 00:54:07,913
-+I'm gonna go to the store.
-+
-+709
-+00:54:08,538 --> 00:54:10,540
-+I'll be back in 20 minutes.
-+
-+710
-+00:54:10,749 --> 00:54:13,835
-+Alternatively, we could order a pizza?
-+
-+711
-+00:54:15,003 --> 00:54:17,881
-+Vision, are you not letting me leave?
-+
-+712
-+00:54:19,549 --> 00:54:21,343
-+It is a question of safety.
-+
-+713
-+00:54:21,509 --> 00:54:23,428
-+I can protect myself.
-+
-+714
-+00:54:24,846 --> 00:54:26,264
-+Not yours.
-+
-+715
-+00:54:27,891 --> 00:54:30,518
-+Mr Stark would like to
-+avoid the possibility
-+
-+716
-+00:54:30,685 --> 00:54:32,479
-+of another public incident.
-+
-+717
-+00:54:32,854 --> 00:54:36,900
-+Until the Accords are on
-+a more secure foundation.
-+
-+718
-+00:54:39,486 --> 00:54:41,529
-+And what do you want?
-+
-+719
-+00:54:42,656 --> 00:54:44,157
-+For people to see you...
-+
-+720
-+00:54:45,033 --> 00:54:46,534
-+as I do.
-+
-+721
-+00:55:19,693 --> 00:55:20,694
-+So, you like cats?
-+
-+722
-+00:55:20,860 --> 00:55:22,529
-+- Sam.
-+- What?
-+
-+723
-+00:55:22,821 --> 00:55:25,281
-+Dude shows up dressed like a cat,
-+you don't wanna know more?
-+
-+724
-+00:55:27,492 --> 00:55:29,244
-+Your suit... it's vibranium?
-+
-+725
-+00:55:32,914 --> 00:55:35,125
-+The Black Panther
-+has been the protector
-+
-+726
-+00:55:35,208 --> 00:55:37,127
-+of Wakanda for generations.
-+
-+727
-+00:55:38,211 --> 00:55:41,506
-+A mantle, passed from warrior to warrior.
-+
-+728
-+00:55:43,049 --> 00:55:45,802
-+And now, because your friend
-+murdered my father...
-+
-+729
-+00:55:46,594 --> 00:55:49,264
-+I also wear the mantle of king.
-+
-+730
-+00:55:50,098 --> 00:55:51,558
-+So, I ask you...
-+
-+731
-+00:55:51,641 --> 00:55:54,644
-+as both warrior and king...
-+
-+732
-+00:55:55,854 --> 00:55:59,607
-+how long do you think you can
-+keep your friend safe from me?
-+
-+733
-+00:56:19,419 --> 00:56:20,712
-+What's gonna happen to him?
-+
-+734
-+00:56:20,879 --> 00:56:23,089
-+Same thing that ought to happen to you.
-+
-+735
-+00:56:23,173 --> 00:56:25,383
-+Psychological evaluation
-+and extradition.
-+
-+736
-+00:56:25,550 --> 00:56:27,260
-+This is Everett Ross,
-+Deputy Task Force Commander.
-+
-+737
-+00:56:27,969 --> 00:56:28,970
-+What about a lawyer?
-+
-+738
-+00:56:29,137 --> 00:56:30,805
-+Lawyer. That's funny.
-+
-+739
-+00:56:31,139 --> 00:56:33,099
-+See their weapons are placed in lockup.
-+
-+740
-+00:56:33,266 --> 00:56:35,143
-+We'll write you a receipt.
-+
-+741
-+00:56:35,310 --> 00:56:38,646
-+I better not look out the window
-+and see anybody flying around in that.
-+
-+742
-+00:56:44,694 --> 00:56:46,279
-+You'll be
-+provided with an office
-+
-+743
-+00:56:46,362 --> 00:56:47,739
-+instead of a cell.
-+
-+744
-+00:56:47,822 --> 00:56:49,741
-+Now, do me a favour, stay in it?
-+
-+745
-+00:56:50,492 --> 00:56:52,452
-+I don't intend on going anywhere.
-+
-+746
-+00:56:52,619 --> 00:56:56,247
-+For the record, this is what
-+making things worse looks like.
-+
-+747
-+00:56:56,539 --> 00:56:57,665
-+He's alive.
-+
-+748
-+00:56:57,999 --> 00:56:59,542
-+No.
-+
-+749
-+00:56:59,793 --> 00:57:02,003
-+Romania was not Accords-sanctioned.
-+
-+750
-+00:57:02,170 --> 00:57:03,797
-+Colonel Rhodes is supervising cleanup.
-+
-+751
-+00:57:03,963 --> 00:57:05,882
-+Try not to break anything
-+while we fix this.
-+
-+752
-+00:57:06,049 --> 00:57:08,426
-+Consequences? You bet
-+there'll be consequences.
-+
-+753
-+00:57:08,593 --> 00:57:10,220
-+Obviously you can quote me on that,
-+
-+754
-+00:57:10,303 --> 00:57:11,763
-+because I just said it. Anything else?
-+
-+755
-+00:57:11,846 --> 00:57:12,889
-+Thank you, sir.
-+
-+756
-+00:57:14,140 --> 00:57:15,433
-+"Consequences"?
-+
-+757
-+00:57:15,558 --> 00:57:16,810
-+Secretary Ross
-+wants you both prosecuted.
-+
-+758
-+00:57:17,060 --> 00:57:18,353
-+Had to give him something.
-+
-+759
-+00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:19,813
-+I'm not getting that shield back, am I?
-+
-+760
-+00:57:20,438 --> 00:57:21,689
-+Technically, it's the
-+government's property.
-+
-+761
-+00:57:21,773 --> 00:57:22,816
-+Wings, too.
-+
-+762
-+00:57:22,982 --> 00:57:24,192
-+That's cold.
-+
-+763
-+00:57:24,526 --> 00:57:25,777
-+Warmer than jail.
-+
-+764
-+00:57:53,513 --> 00:57:55,598
-+Hey, you wanna see
-+something cool?
-+
-+765
-+00:57:56,391 --> 00:57:58,560
-+I pulled something from Dad's archives.
-+
-+766
-+00:58:00,019 --> 00:58:01,396
-+Felt timely.
-+
-+767
-+00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:08,987
-+FDR signed the Lend-Lease bill
-+with these in 1941.
-+
-+768
-+00:58:09,654 --> 00:58:12,574
-+Provided support to the Allies
-+when they needed it most.
-+
-+769
-+00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:14,742
-+Some would say it brought
-+our country closer to war.
-+
-+770
-+00:58:16,452 --> 00:58:18,872
-+See? If not for these,
-+you wouldn't be here.
-+
-+771
-+00:58:20,498 --> 00:58:23,001
-+I'm trying to... What do you call it?
-+
-+772
-+00:58:23,293 --> 00:58:25,253
-+That's an olive branch.
-+
-+773
-+00:58:26,087 --> 00:58:27,589
-+Is that what you call it?
-+
-+774
-+00:58:29,007 --> 00:58:31,467
-+Is Pepper here? I didn't see her.
-+
-+775
-+00:58:32,719 --> 00:58:35,013
-+We're kinda...
-+
-+776
-+00:58:35,597 --> 00:58:37,265
-+- Well, not kinda...
-+- Pregnant?
-+
-+777
-+00:58:37,724 --> 00:58:39,225
-+No. Definitely not.
-+
-+778
-+00:58:39,392 --> 00:58:41,186
-+We're taking a break.
-+
-+779
-+00:58:41,352 --> 00:58:42,562
-+It's nobody's fault.
-+
-+780
-+00:58:44,147 --> 00:58:45,607
-+I'm so sorry, Tony. I didn't know.
-+
-+781
-+00:58:46,399 --> 00:58:49,360
-+A few years ago, I almost lost her,
-+so I trashed all my suits.
-+
-+782
-+00:58:50,486 --> 00:58:52,363
-+Then, we had to mop up HYDRA...
-+
-+783
-+00:58:52,530 --> 00:58:54,866
-+and then Ultron. My fault.
-+
-+784
-+00:58:55,033 --> 00:58:58,244
-+And then, and then, and then,
-+I never stopped.
-+
-+785
-+00:58:58,411 --> 00:59:00,788
-+Because the truth is I don't wanna stop.
-+
-+786
-+00:59:02,165 --> 00:59:04,209
-+I don't wanna lose her.
-+
-+787
-+00:59:04,375 --> 00:59:07,003
-+I thought maybe the Accords
-+could split the difference.
-+
-+788
-+00:59:10,632 --> 00:59:12,800
-+In her defence, I'm a handful.
-+
-+789
-+00:59:14,010 --> 00:59:16,471
-+Yet, Dad was a pain in the ass,
-+
-+790
-+00:59:16,554 --> 00:59:18,348
-+but he and Mom always made it work.
-+
-+791
-+00:59:18,514 --> 00:59:19,974
-+I'm glad Howard got married.
-+
-+792
-+00:59:20,683 --> 00:59:22,644
-+I only knew him
-+when he was young and single.
-+
-+793
-+00:59:22,810 --> 00:59:24,729
-+Oh, really? You two knew each other?
-+
-+794
-+00:59:24,812 --> 00:59:26,189
-+He never mentioned that.
-+
-+795
-+00:59:26,356 --> 00:59:28,983
-+Maybe only a thousand times.
-+
-+796
-+00:59:29,609 --> 00:59:30,985
-+God, I hated you.
-+
-+797
-+00:59:32,987 --> 00:59:34,614
-+I don't mean to make things difficult.
-+
-+798
-+00:59:34,781 --> 00:59:37,075
-+I know, because you're
-+a very polite person.
-+
-+799
-+00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:39,994
-+If I see a situation pointed south...
-+
-+800
-+00:59:40,828 --> 00:59:42,330
-+I can't ignore it.
-+
-+801
-+00:59:42,413 --> 00:59:43,790
-+Sometimes I wish I could.
-+
-+802
-+00:59:43,957 --> 00:59:44,999
-+No, you don't.
-+
-+803
-+00:59:48,127 --> 00:59:49,629
-+No, I don't.
-+
-+804
-+00:59:50,338 --> 00:59:51,339
-+Sometimes...
-+
-+805
-+00:59:51,506 --> 00:59:54,550
-+Sometimes I wanna
-+punch you in your perfect teeth.
-+
-+806
-+00:59:55,134 --> 00:59:56,594
-+But I don't wanna see you gone.
-+
-+807
-+00:59:57,345 --> 00:59:58,846
-+We need you, Cap.
-+
-+808
-+00:59:59,555 --> 01:00:03,017
-+So far, nothing's happened
-+that can't be undone, if you sign.
-+
-+809
-+01:00:03,434 --> 01:00:05,311
-+We can make the last 24 hours legit.
-+
-+810
-+01:00:05,478 --> 01:00:07,689
-+Barnes gets transferred to
-+an American psych-centre...
-+
-+811
-+01:00:07,855 --> 01:00:09,816
-+instead of a Wakandan prison.
-+
-+812
-+01:00:21,661 --> 01:00:22,996
-+I'm not saying it's impossible...
-+
-+813
-+01:00:23,204 --> 01:00:25,206
-+but there would have to be safeguards.
-+
-+814
-+01:00:25,373 --> 01:00:26,416
-+Sure.
-+
-+815
-+01:00:26,624 --> 01:00:28,293
-+Once we put out the PR fire,
-+
-+816
-+01:00:28,376 --> 01:00:30,378
-+those documents can be amended.
-+
-+817
-+01:00:30,545 --> 01:00:32,255
-+I'd file a motion to have
-+you and Wanda reinstated...
-+
-+818
-+01:00:32,463 --> 01:00:34,299
-+Wanda? What about Wanda?
-+
-+819
-+01:00:34,590 --> 01:00:36,134
-+She's fine. She's confined
-+to the compound, currently.
-+
-+820
-+01:00:36,301 --> 01:00:37,510
-+Vision's keeping her company.
-+
-+821
-+01:00:37,677 --> 01:00:38,636
-+Oh, God, Tony.
-+
-+822
-+01:00:38,845 --> 01:00:41,180
-+Every time I think you see
-+things the right way...
-+
-+823
-+01:00:41,347 --> 01:00:42,348
-+It's 100 acres with a lap pool.
-+
-+824
-+01:00:42,432 --> 01:00:43,474
-+It's got a screening room.
-+
-+825
-+01:00:43,558 --> 01:00:44,726
-+There's worse ways to protect people.
-+
-+826
-+01:00:44,809 --> 01:00:45,852
-+Protection?
-+
-+827
-+01:00:46,561 --> 01:00:47,645
-+Is that how you see this?
-+
-+828
-+01:00:47,729 --> 01:00:49,772
-+This is protection? It's internment, Tony.
-+
-+829
-+01:00:49,939 --> 01:00:51,274
-+- She's not a US citizen.
-+- Oh, come on, Tony.
-+
-+830
-+01:00:51,357 --> 01:00:52,859
-+And they don't grant visas
-+to weapons of mass destruction.
-+
-+831
-+01:00:52,942 --> 01:00:53,943
-+She's a kid!
-+
-+832
-+01:00:54,027 --> 01:00:55,403
-+Give me a break!
-+
-+833
-+01:00:56,612 --> 01:00:58,656
-+I'm doing what has to be done.
-+
-+834
-+01:00:58,823 --> 01:01:00,616
-+To stave off something worse.
-+
-+835
-+01:01:03,661 --> 01:01:05,538
-+You keep telling yourself that.
-+
-+836
-+01:01:08,666 --> 01:01:09,959
-+Hate to break up the set.
-+
-+837
-+01:01:17,425 --> 01:01:19,302
-+<i>Hello, Mr Barnes.</i>
-+
-+838
-+01:01:19,969 --> 01:01:22,347
-+<i>I've been sent by
-+the United Nations to evaluate you.</i>
-+
-+839
-+01:01:22,513 --> 01:01:24,724
-+<i>Do you mind if I sit?</i>
-+
-+840
-+01:01:29,645 --> 01:01:31,356
-+<i>Your first name is James?</i>
-+
-+841
-+01:01:32,857 --> 01:01:34,776
-+The receipt for your gear.
-+
-+842
-+01:01:36,611 --> 01:01:38,279
-+"Bird costume"? Come on.
-+
-+843
-+01:01:38,446 --> 01:01:40,156
-+I didn't write it.
-+
-+844
-+01:01:46,162 --> 01:01:47,747
-+<i>I'm not here to judge you.</i>
-+
-+845
-+01:01:48,206 --> 01:01:49,624
-+<i>I just want to ask you a few questions.</i>
-+
-+846
-+01:01:51,459 --> 01:01:53,711
-+<i>Do you know where you are, James?</i>

-+<i>My name is Bucky.</i>
-+
-+849
-+01:02:11,145 --> 01:02:12,647
-+Hello?
-+
-+850
-+01:02:19,737 --> 01:02:20,822
-+Hey!
-+
-+851
-+01:02:41,259 --> 01:02:44,011
-+Why would the Task Force
-+release this photo to begin with?
-+
-+852
-+01:02:44,387 --> 01:02:46,681
-+Get the word out,
-+involve as many eyes as we can?
-+
-+853
-+01:02:46,848 --> 01:02:49,725
-+Right. It's a good way
-+to flush a guy out of hiding.
-+
-+854
-+01:02:49,892 --> 01:02:51,894
-+Set off a bomb, get your picture taken.
-+
-+855
-+01:02:52,061 --> 01:02:54,188
-+Get seven billion people looking
-+for the Winter Soldier.
-+
-+856
-+01:02:54,272 --> 01:02:56,107
-+You're saying someone
-+framed him to find him?
-+
-+857
-+01:02:56,274 --> 01:02:57,275
-+Steve, we looked
-+for the guy for two years
-+
-+858
-+01:02:57,358 --> 01:02:58,401
-+and found nothing.
-+
-+859
-+01:02:58,526 --> 01:03:00,528
-+We didn't bomb the UN.
-+That turns a lot of heads.
-+
-+860
-+01:03:00,611 --> 01:03:01,946
-+Yeah,
-+but that doesn't guarantee
-+
-+861
-+01:03:02,029 --> 01:03:03,197
-+that whoever framed him would get him.
-+
-+862
-+01:03:03,281 --> 01:03:05,116
-+It guarantees that we would.
-+
-+863
-+01:03:11,205 --> 01:03:12,039
-+Yeah.
-+
-+864
-+01:03:14,959 --> 01:03:16,377
-+Tell me, Bucky.
-+
-+865
-+01:03:16,711 --> 01:03:19,088
-+You've seen a great deal, haven't you?
-+
-+866
-+01:03:20,465 --> 01:03:22,550
-+<i>I don't wanna talk about it.</i>
-+
-+867
-+01:03:23,217 --> 01:03:25,845
-+You fear that if you open your mouth,
-+
-+868
-+01:03:25,928 --> 01:03:27,722
-+the horrors might never stop.
-+
-+869
-+01:03:31,392 --> 01:03:32,477
-+Don't worry.
-+
-+870
-+01:03:35,605 --> 01:03:37,899
-+We only have to talk about one.
-+
-+871
-+01:04:02,131 --> 01:04:04,091
-+Come on, guys, get me eyes on Barnes.
-+
-+872
-+01:04:04,926 --> 01:04:07,512
-+Friday, get me a source on that outage.
-+

-+Sub-level five, East Wing.
-+

-+What the hell is this?
-+
-+875
-+01:04:15,978 --> 01:04:17,605
-+Why don't we discuss your home?
-+
-+876
-+01:04:17,772 --> 01:04:20,816
-+Not Romania.
-+Certainly not Brooklyn, no.
-+
-+877
-+01:04:21,859 --> 01:04:25,363
-+I mean your real home.

-+Help me.
-+
-+895
-+01:05:51,240 --> 01:05:52,241
-+Help.
-+
-+896
-+01:05:55,244 --> 01:05:56,245
-+Get up.
-+
-+897
-+01:05:59,707 --> 01:06:01,542
-+Who are you? What do you want?
-+
-+898
-+01:06:02,918 --> 01:06:04,920
-+To see an empire fall.
-+
-+899
-+01:06:37,078 --> 01:06:38,079
-+Hey.
-+
-+900
-+01:06:44,794 --> 01:06:46,170
-+Evac all civilians.
-+
-+901
-+01:06:46,337 --> 01:06:48,547
-+Get me a perimeter around the building,
-+and gunships in the air.
-+
-+902
-+01:06:48,756 --> 01:06:50,257
-+Please tell me you brought a suit.
-+
-+903
-+01:06:50,424 --> 01:06:52,885
-+Sure did. It's a lovely Tom Ford,
-+three-piece, two-button.
-+
-+904
-+01:06:53,010 --> 01:06:54,512
-+I'm an active-duty non-combatant.
-+
-+905
-+01:06:55,137 --> 01:06:56,514
-+Follow me.
-+

-+<i>We're in position.</i>
-+
-+907
-+01:07:46,897 --> 01:07:48,816
-+You could at least recognise me.
-+
-+908
-+01:08:41,952 --> 01:08:43,162
-+Damn it.
-+
-+909
-+01:10:20,467 --> 01:10:22,678
-+<i>He asked me again
-+if you were going to be there.</i>
-+
-+910
-+01:10:22,761 --> 01:10:24,722
-+<i>I said I wasn't sure.</i>
-+
-+911
-+01:10:24,805 --> 01:10:27,641
-+<i>You should have seen his
-+little face. Just try, okay?</i>
-+
-+912
-+01:10:28,309 --> 01:10:30,060
-+<i>I'm going to bed.</i>

-+James Barnes the suspect

-+
-+915
-+01:10:39,653 --> 01:10:41,155
-+...escaped custody today.
-+
-+916
-+01:10:41,405 --> 01:10:44,366
-+...also missing Avenger
-+Captain Steve Rogers...
-+
-+917
-+01:10:44,491 --> 01:10:45,451
-+and Sam Wilson.
-+
-+918
-+01:11:09,516 --> 01:11:10,517
-+Hey, Cap!
-+
-+919
-+01:11:23,322 --> 01:11:24,406
-+Steve.
-+
-+920
-+01:11:25,407 --> 01:11:27,618
-+Which Bucky am I talking to?
-+
-+921
-+01:11:29,244 --> 01:11:31,330
-+Your mom's name was Sarah.
-+
-+922
-+01:11:35,459 --> 01:11:38,712
-+You used to wear newspapers
-+in your shoes.
-+
-+923
-+01:11:40,130 --> 01:11:41,340
-+Can't read that in a museum.
-+
-+924
-+01:11:41,507 --> 01:11:43,217
-+Just like that,
-+we're supposed to be cool?
-+
-+925
-+01:11:43,592 --> 01:11:45,010
-+What did I do?
-+
-+926
-+01:11:45,135 --> 01:11:45,886
-+Enough.
-+
-+927
-+01:11:46,053 --> 01:11:47,846
-+Oh, God, I knew this would happen.
-+
-+928
-+01:11:48,013 --> 01:11:50,307
-+Everything HYDRA
-+put inside me is still there.
-+
-+929
-+01:11:50,557 --> 01:11:52,393
-+All he had to do
-+was say the goddamn words.
-+
-+930
-+01:11:52,601 --> 01:11:54,228
-+- Who was he?
-+- I don't know.
-+
-+931
-+01:11:54,395 --> 01:11:56,355
-+People are dead.
-+The bombing, the setup...
-+
-+932
-+01:11:56,563 --> 01:11:58,899
-+the doctor did all that just
-+to get 10 minutes with you.
-+
-+933
-+01:11:59,149 --> 01:12:00,901
-+I need you to do
-+better than "I don't know."
-+
-+934
-+01:12:04,613 --> 01:12:07,241
-+He wanted to know about Siberia.
-+
-+935
-+01:12:09,910 --> 01:12:11,620
-+Where I was kept.
-+
-+936
-+01:12:13,414 --> 01:12:15,165
-+He wanted to know exactly where.
-+
-+937
-+01:12:15,416 --> 01:12:17,626
-+Why would he need to know that?
-+
-+938
-+01:12:19,712 --> 01:12:22,047
-+Because I'm not the only Winter Soldier.
-+
-+939
-+01:13:15,768 --> 01:13:17,394
-+It hurts!
-+
-+940
-+01:13:55,015 --> 01:13:56,183
-+Good work.
-+
-+941
-+01:14:07,361 --> 01:14:08,737
-+Get me out of here.
-+
-+942
-+01:14:22,751 --> 01:14:23,877
-+Who were they?
-+
-+943
-+01:14:24,044 --> 01:14:25,629
-+Their most elite death squad.
-+
-+944
-+01:14:25,796 --> 01:14:27,881
-+More kills than anyone
-+in HYDRA history.
-+
-+945
-+01:14:28,048 --> 01:14:29,341
-+And that was before the serum.
-+
-+946
-+01:14:29,508 --> 01:14:30,634
-+They all turn out like you?
-+
-+947
-+01:14:30,801 --> 01:14:31,885
-+Worse.
-+
-+948
-+01:14:32,511 --> 01:14:34,304
-+The doctor, could he control them?
-+
-+949
-+01:14:35,264 --> 01:14:36,682
-+Enough.
-+
-+950
-+01:14:36,849 --> 01:14:38,684
-+Said he wanted to see an empire fall.
-+
-+951
-+01:14:38,934 --> 01:14:40,561
-+With these guys, he could do it.
-+
-+952
-+01:14:40,853 --> 01:14:43,188
-+They speak 30 languages,
-+can hide in plain sight...
-+
-+953
-+01:14:43,272 --> 01:14:45,482
-+infiltrate, assassinate, destabilise.
-+
-+954
-+01:14:45,566 --> 01:14:47,109
-+They can take a whole country down
-+
-+955
-+01:14:47,192 --> 01:14:48,652
-+in one night,
-+you'd never see them coming.
-+
-+956
-+01:14:51,363 --> 01:14:53,407
-+This would have been
-+a lot easier a week ago.
-+
-+957
-+01:14:53,991 --> 01:14:56,118
-+- If we call Tony...
-+- No, he won't believe us.
-+
-+958
-+01:14:56,201 --> 01:14:57,202
-+Even if he did...
-+
-+959
-+01:14:57,286 --> 01:14:59,079
-+Who knows if the Accords
-+would let him help.
-+
-+960
-+01:15:00,539 --> 01:15:01,540
-+We're on our own.
-+
-+961
-+01:15:02,958 --> 01:15:03,792
-+Maybe not.
-+
-+962
-+01:15:05,878 --> 01:15:07,421
-+I know a guy.
-+
-+963
-+01:15:08,380 --> 01:15:11,341
-+I don't suppose you have
-+any idea where they are?
-+
-+964
-+01:15:11,425 --> 01:15:12,384
-+We will.
-+
-+965
-+01:15:12,593 --> 01:15:14,178
-+GSG 9's got the borders covered.
-+
-+966
-+01:15:14,261 --> 01:15:16,054
-+Recon's flying 24/7.
-+
-+967
-+01:15:16,221 --> 01:15:17,723
-+They'll get a hit. We'll handle it.
-+
-+968
-+01:15:17,806 --> 01:15:19,641
-+You don't get it, Stark.
-+It's not yours to handle.
-+
-+969
-+01:15:19,892 --> 01:15:22,227
-+It's clear you can't be objective.
-+
-+970
-+01:15:22,394 --> 01:15:23,896
-+I'm putting Special Ops on this.
-+
-+971
-+01:15:23,979 --> 01:15:25,147
-+What happens
-+when the shooting starts?
-+
-+972
-+01:15:25,230 --> 01:15:26,523
-+What, do you kill Steve Rogers?
-+
-+973
-+01:15:26,607 --> 01:15:27,941
-+If we're provoked.
-+
-+974
-+01:15:28,108 --> 01:15:31,403
-+Barnes would've been eliminated
-+in Romania if it wasn't for Rogers.
-+
-+975
-+01:15:31,570 --> 01:15:35,365
-+There are dead people
-+who would be alive now.
-+
-+976
-+01:15:36,450 --> 01:15:38,285
-+Feel free to check my math.
-+
-+977
-+01:15:38,493 --> 01:15:39,828
-+All due respect,
-+you're not gonna solve this
-+
-+978
-+01:15:39,912 --> 01:15:41,163
-+with boys and bullets, Ross.
-+
-+979
-+01:15:41,246 --> 01:15:42,456
-+You gotta let us bring them in.
-+
-+980
-+01:15:42,706 --> 01:15:44,625
-+How would that end
-+any differently than last time?
-+
-+981
-+01:15:44,791 --> 01:15:45,751
-+Because this time,
-+
-+982
-+01:15:45,834 --> 01:15:47,461
-+I won't be wearing loafers
-+and a silk shirt.
-+
-+983
-+01:15:48,795 --> 01:15:50,672
-+72 hours, guaranteed.
-+
-+984
-+01:15:50,839 --> 01:15:52,674
-+36 hours.
-+
-+985
-+01:15:54,218 --> 01:15:55,510
-+Barnes.
-+
-+986
-+01:15:57,012 --> 01:15:58,347
-+Rogers.
-+
-+987
-+01:15:59,139 --> 01:16:00,098
-+Wilson.
-+
-+988
-+01:16:00,182 --> 01:16:01,975
-+Thank you, sir.
-+
-+989
-+01:16:05,604 --> 01:16:07,481
-+My left arm is numb. Is that normal?
-+
-+990
-+01:16:10,943 --> 01:16:12,027
-+You all right?
-+
-+991
-+01:16:12,194 --> 01:16:13,278
-+Always.
-+
-+992
-+01:16:17,366 --> 01:16:19,618
-+36 hours. Jeez.
-+
-+993
-+01:16:19,785 --> 01:16:21,828
-+We're seriously understaffed.
-+
-+994
-+01:16:21,995 --> 01:16:23,163
-+Oh, yeah.
-+
-+995
-+01:16:23,330 --> 01:16:26,291
-+It'd be great if we had
-+a Hulk right about now. Any shot?
-+
-+996
-+01:16:28,252 --> 01:16:30,879
-+You really think he'd be on our side?
-+
-+997
-+01:16:31,046 --> 01:16:32,089
-+No.
-+
-+998
-+01:16:32,256 --> 01:16:33,548
-+I have an idea.
-+
-+999
-+01:16:33,715 --> 01:16:36,009
-+Me, too. Where's yours?
-+
-+1000
-+01:16:36,218 --> 01:16:38,011
-+Downstairs.
-+
-+1001
-+01:16:38,178 --> 01:16:39,346
-+Where's yours?
-+
-+1002
-+01:17:01,326 --> 01:17:02,703
-+Hey, May.
-+
-+1003
-+01:17:02,869 --> 01:17:04,037
-+Mmm. Hey.
-+
-+1004
-+01:17:06,164 --> 01:17:07,916
-+How was school today?
-+
-+1005
-+01:17:08,083 --> 01:17:09,334
-+It was okay.
-+
-+1006
-+01:17:09,501 --> 01:17:11,795
-+This crazy car parked outside.
-+
-+1007
-+01:17:15,299 --> 01:17:17,259
-+- Oh, Mr Parker.
-+- Um...
-+
-+1008
-+01:17:19,261 --> 01:17:21,305
-+What are you doing...
-+
-+1009
-+01:17:21,471 --> 01:17:23,265
-+Hey! Uh, I'm Peter.
-+
-+1010
-+01:17:23,432 --> 01:17:24,683
-+Tony.
-+
-+1011
-+01:17:25,183 --> 01:17:26,727
-+What are you doing here?
-+
-+1012
-+01:17:26,893 --> 01:17:28,186
-+It's about time we met.
-+
-+1013
-+01:17:28,270 --> 01:17:29,980
-+You've been getting my emails, right?
-+
-+1014
-+01:17:30,188 --> 01:17:31,773
-+- Yeah. Yeah.
-+- Right?
-+
-+1015
-+01:17:31,982 --> 01:17:32,983
-+Regarding the...
-+
-+1016
-+01:17:33,066 --> 01:17:34,067
-+You didn't even tell me about the grant.
-+
-+1017
-+01:17:34,234 --> 01:17:35,736
-+- About the grant.
-+- The September Foundation.
-+
-+1018
-+01:17:35,902 --> 01:17:36,862
-+- Right.
-+- Yeah.
-+
-+1019
-+01:17:36,945 --> 01:17:37,946
-+Remember when you applied?
-+
-+1020
-+01:17:38,071 --> 01:17:39,114
-+Yeah.
-+
-+1021
-+01:17:39,281 --> 01:17:41,783
-+I approved, so now we're in business.
-+
-+1022
-+01:17:42,409 --> 01:17:44,369
-+But you didn't tell me anything.
-+What's up with that?
-+
-+1023
-+01:17:44,619 --> 01:17:45,579
-+You keeping secrets from me now?
-+
-+1024
-+01:17:45,787 --> 01:17:49,583
-+I just know how much you love surprises
-+so I thought I would let you know...
-+
-+1025
-+01:17:50,250 --> 01:17:51,752
-+Anyway, what did I apply for?
-+
-+1026
-+01:17:51,918 --> 01:17:52,919
-+That's what I'm here to hash out.
-+
-+1027
-+01:17:53,086 --> 01:17:54,463
-+Okay. Hash it out, okay.
-+
-+1028
-+01:17:54,546 --> 01:17:57,174
-+It's so hard for me to believe
-+that she's someone's aunt.
-+
-+1029
-+01:17:57,341 --> 01:17:59,593
-+Yeah, well, we come in
-+all shapes and sizes, you know?
-+
-+1030
-+01:18:00,052 --> 01:18:02,220
-+This walnut date loaf is exceptional.
-+
-+1031
-+01:18:02,512 --> 01:18:03,764
-+- Let me just stop you there.
-+- Yeah.
-+
-+1032
-+01:18:03,930 --> 01:18:07,726
-+Is this grant got money
-+involved or whatever? No?
-+
-+1033
-+01:18:07,893 --> 01:18:09,144
-+Yeah, it's pretty well funded.
-+
-+1034
-+01:18:09,227 --> 01:18:10,395
-+Yeah? Wow.
-+
-+1035
-+01:18:10,479 --> 01:18:12,105
-+Look who you're talking to.
-+
-+1036
-+01:18:12,272 --> 01:18:14,316
-+- Can I have five minutes with him?
-+- Sure.
-+
-+1037
-+01:18:20,238 --> 01:18:23,533
-+As walnut date loaves go,
-+that wasn't bad.
-+
-+1038
-+01:18:24,826 --> 01:18:27,621
-+Whoa, what have we here?
-+Retro tech, huh?
-+
-+1039
-+01:18:27,829 --> 01:18:29,581
-+Thrift store? Salvation Army?
-+
-+1040
-+01:18:29,790 --> 01:18:31,666
-+- Uh, the garbage, actually.
-+- You're a dumpster diver?
-+
-+1041
-+01:18:31,875 --> 01:18:32,959
-+Yeah, I was...
-+
-+1042
-+01:18:33,043 --> 01:18:34,503
-+Anyway, look, um,
-+
-+1043
-+01:18:34,586 --> 01:18:36,129
-+I definitely did not apply
-+for your grant...
-+
-+1044
-+01:18:36,380 --> 01:18:37,923
-+- Ah-ah! Me first.
-+- Okay.
-+
-+1045
-+01:18:38,006 --> 01:18:40,509
-+Quick question of the rhetorical variety.
-+
-+1046
-+01:18:41,843 --> 01:18:43,804
-+That's you, right?
-+
-+1047
-+01:18:44,179 --> 01:18:45,180
-+Um, no.
-+
-+1048
-+01:18:45,347 --> 01:18:46,807
-+- What do you mean?
-+- Yeah.
-+
-+1049
-+01:18:47,808 --> 01:18:49,434
-+Look at you go.
-+
-+1050
-+01:18:49,601 --> 01:18:52,729
-+Wow! Nice catch.
-+3,000 pounds, 40 miles an hour.
-+
-+1051
-+01:18:52,896 --> 01:18:55,649
-+That's not easy. You got mad skills.
-+
-+1052
-+01:18:55,899 --> 01:18:57,734
-+That's all on YouTube, though, right?
-+
-+1053
-+01:18:57,818 --> 01:18:59,319
-+That's where you found that?
-+
-+1054
-+01:18:59,486 --> 01:19:00,529
-+Because you know that's all fake.
-+
-+1055
-+01:19:00,612 --> 01:19:01,613
-+It's all done on the computer.
-+
-+1056
-+01:19:01,863 --> 01:19:02,906
-+Mmm-hmm.
-+
-+1057
-+01:19:02,989 --> 01:19:05,075
-+It's like that video. What is it?
-+
-+1058
-+01:19:05,242 --> 01:19:07,035
-+Yeah. Oh, you mean like
-+those UFOs over Phoenix?
-+
-+1059
-+01:19:07,202 --> 01:19:08,120
-+Exactly.
-+
-+1060
-+01:19:08,537 --> 01:19:09,830
-+Oh, what have we here?
-+
-+1061
-+01:19:11,206 --> 01:19:12,916
-+Uh...
-+
-+1062
-+01:19:18,964 --> 01:19:20,799
-+You're the Spider-ling.
-+
-+1063
-+01:19:20,966 --> 01:19:22,843
-+Crime-fighting spider.
-+You're Spider-Boy?
-+
-+1064
-+01:19:25,679 --> 01:19:27,264
-+Spider-Man.
-+
-+1065
-+01:19:27,639 --> 01:19:29,474
-+Not in that onesie, you're not.
-+
-+1066
-+01:19:30,016 --> 01:19:31,935
-+It's not a onesie.
-+
-+1067
-+01:19:33,353 --> 01:19:34,646
-+I don't believe this.
-+I was actually having
-+
-+1068
-+01:19:34,729 --> 01:19:36,523
-+a really good day today, Mr Stark.
-+
-+1069
-+01:19:36,690 --> 01:19:39,860
-+Didn't miss my train, this perfectly good
-+DVD player was just sitting there...
-+
-+1070
-+01:19:40,485 --> 01:19:43,113
-+and Algebra test, nailed it.
-+
-+1071
-+01:19:43,905 --> 01:19:45,365
-+Who else knows? Anybody?
-+
-+1072
-+01:19:46,950 --> 01:19:48,076
-+Nobody.
-+
-+1073
-+01:19:48,452 --> 01:19:50,454
-+Not even your unusually attractive aunt?
-+
-+1074
-+01:19:50,620 --> 01:19:51,913
-+No. No.
-+
-+1075
-+01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:54,666
-+No! If she knew, she would freak out.
-+
-+1076
-+01:19:54,833 --> 01:19:56,543
-+And when she freaks out, I freak out.
-+
-+1077
-+01:19:56,835 --> 01:19:58,753
-+You know what I think
-+is really cool? This webbing.
-+
-+1078
-+01:20:00,130 --> 01:20:02,507
-+That tensile strength is off the charts.
-+
-+1079
-+01:20:02,591 --> 01:20:03,967
-+Who manufactured that?
-+
-+1080
-+01:20:04,259 --> 01:20:05,469
-+I did.
-+
-+1081
-+01:20:06,553 --> 01:20:08,138
-+Climbing walls, how you doing that?
-+
-+1082
-+01:20:08,305 --> 01:20:09,556
-+Adhesive gloves?
-+
-+1083
-+01:20:09,723 --> 01:20:11,016
-+It's a long story. I was...
-+
-+1084
-+01:20:11,641 --> 01:20:13,852
-+Lordy! Can you even see in these?
-+
-+1085
-+01:20:14,019 --> 01:20:15,020
-+Yes, I can.
-+
-+1086
-+01:20:15,187 --> 01:20:16,354
-+I'm blind!
-+
-+1087
-+01:20:17,314 --> 01:20:18,899
-+I can see in those.
-+
-+1088
-+01:20:19,065 --> 01:20:19,900
-+Okay?
-+
-+1089
-+01:20:20,066 --> 01:20:22,402
-+It's just that when whatever
-+happened, happened...
-+
-+1090
-+01:20:22,486 --> 01:20:24,779
-+it's like my senses
-+have been dialled to 11.
-+
-+1091
-+01:20:25,322 --> 01:20:29,618
-+There's way too much input,
-+so they just kinda help me focus.
-+
-+1092
-+01:20:29,910 --> 01:20:32,204
-+You're in dire need of an upgrade.
-+
-+1093
-+01:20:32,287 --> 01:20:34,664
-+Systemic, top to bottom,
-+hundred-point restoration.
-+
-+1094
-+01:20:34,748 --> 01:20:35,874
-+That's why I'm here.
-+
-+1095
-+01:20:38,793 --> 01:20:39,920
-+Why you doing this?
-+
-+1096
-+01:20:41,338 --> 01:20:42,506
-+I gotta know, what's your MO?
-+
-+1097
-+01:20:42,589 --> 01:20:43,924
-+What gets you outta that
-+twin bed in the morning?
-+
-+1098
-+01:20:45,133 --> 01:20:46,343
-+Because...
-+
-+1099
-+01:20:50,388 --> 01:20:52,349
-+Because I've been me my whole life,
-+
-+1100
-+01:20:52,432 --> 01:20:54,100
-+and I've had these powers
-+for six months.
-+
-+1101
-+01:20:54,559 --> 01:20:55,727
-+Mmm-hmm.
-+
-+1102
-+01:20:55,810 --> 01:20:58,188
-+I read books, I build computers.
-+
-+1103
-+01:20:59,397 --> 01:21:02,067
-+Yeah, I would love to play football,
-+
-+1104
-+01:21:02,150 --> 01:21:03,693
-+but I couldn't then, so I shouldn't now.
-+
-+1105
-+01:21:03,944 --> 01:21:05,445
-+Sure, because you're different.
-+
-+1106
-+01:21:05,612 --> 01:21:08,532
-+Exactly. But I can't tell
-+anybody that, so I'm not.
-+
-+1107
-+01:21:12,244 --> 01:21:16,540
-+When you can do the things
-+that I can, but you don't...
-+
-+1108
-+01:21:18,959 --> 01:21:21,086
-+and then the bad things happen...
-+
-+1109
-+01:21:21,836 --> 01:21:23,463
-+they happen because of you.
-+
-+1110
-+01:21:28,134 --> 01:21:30,720
-+So you wanna look out for the little guy,
-+you wanna do your part?
-+
-+1111
-+01:21:30,887 --> 01:21:33,098
-+Make the world
-+a better place, all that, right?
-+
-+1112
-+01:21:33,348 --> 01:21:35,892
-+Yeah, just looking out for the little guy.
-+
-+1113
-+01:21:36,893 --> 01:21:38,478
-+That's what it is.
-+
-+1114
-+01:21:45,735 --> 01:21:47,904
-+I'm gonna sit here, so you move the leg.
-+
-+1115
-+01:21:56,830 --> 01:21:58,039
-+You got a passport?
-+
-+1116
-+01:21:58,123 --> 01:21:59,499
-+No, I don't even have a driver's licence.
-+
-+1117
-+01:21:59,666 --> 01:22:01,126
-+- You ever been to Germany?
-+- No.
-+
-+1118
-+01:22:01,209 --> 01:22:02,210
-+Oh, you'll love it.
-+
-+1119
-+01:22:02,419 --> 01:22:04,337
-+- I can't go to Germany.
-+- Why?
-+
-+1120
-+01:22:06,798 --> 01:22:08,008
-+I got homework.
-+
-+1121
-+01:22:08,675 --> 01:22:10,594
-+I'm gonna pretend you didn't say that.
-+
-+1122
-+01:22:10,844 --> 01:22:12,721
-+No, I'm being serious.
-+I can't just drop out of school.
-+
-+1123
-+01:22:12,929 --> 01:22:14,014
-+Might be a little dangerous.
-+
-+1124
-+01:22:14,097 --> 01:22:15,932
-+Better tell Aunt Hottie
-+I'm taking you on a field trip.
-+
-+1125
-+01:22:18,810 --> 01:22:20,645
-+Don't tell Aunt May.
-+
-+1126
-+01:22:21,479 --> 01:22:22,564
-+All right, Spider-Man.
-+
-+1127
-+01:22:26,192 --> 01:22:27,402
-+Get me out of this.
-+
-+1128
-+01:22:27,569 --> 01:22:28,612
-+Sorry. I'll get the...
-+
-+1129
-+01:22:41,541 --> 01:22:42,792
-+What is it?
-+
-+1130
-+01:22:42,959 --> 01:22:44,377
-+Stay here, please.
-+
-+1131
-+01:22:51,009 --> 01:22:52,510
-+Guess I shoulda knocked.
-+
-+1132
-+01:22:52,844 --> 01:22:56,097
-+Oh, my God! What are you doing here?
-+
-+1133
-+01:22:56,264 --> 01:22:58,558
-+Disappointing my kids.
-+
-+1134
-+01:23:02,103 --> 01:23:03,855
-+I'm supposed to go waterskiing.
-+
-+1135
-+01:23:04,356 --> 01:23:06,149
-+Cap needs our help. Come on.
-+
-+1136
-+01:23:06,483 --> 01:23:07,484
-+Clint!
-+
-+1137
-+01:23:09,402 --> 01:23:10,695
-+You should not be here.
-+
-+1138
-+01:23:13,031 --> 01:23:14,282
-+Really?
-+
-+1139
-+01:23:14,783 --> 01:23:17,869
-+I retire for, what, like five minutes,
-+and it all goes to shit.
-+
-+1140
-+01:23:18,119 --> 01:23:20,330
-+Please consider
-+the consequences of your actions.
-+
-+1141
-+01:23:20,497 --> 01:23:21,414
-+Okay, they're considered.
-+
-+1142
-+01:23:22,874 --> 01:23:24,376
-+Okay, we gotta go.
-+
-+1143
-+01:23:28,755 --> 01:23:30,048
-+It's this way.
-+
-+1144
-+01:23:30,507 --> 01:23:32,425
-+I've caused enough problems.
-+
-+1145
-+01:23:36,971 --> 01:23:38,473
-+You gotta help me, Wanda.
-+
-+1146
-+01:23:38,640 --> 01:23:40,350
-+Look, you wanna mope,
-+you can go to high school.
-+
-+1147
-+01:23:40,517 --> 01:23:42,560
-+You wanna make amends,
-+you get off your ass.
-+
-+1148
-+01:23:43,561 --> 01:23:44,187
-+Shit.
-+
-+1149
-+01:23:51,152 --> 01:23:52,904
-+I knew I should've stretched.
-+
-+1150
-+01:24:06,501 --> 01:24:09,003
-+Clint, you can't overpower me.
-+
-+1151
-+01:24:09,170 --> 01:24:11,005
-+I know I can't.
-+
-+1152
-+01:24:11,589 --> 01:24:13,174
-+But she can.
-+
-+1153
-+01:24:14,718 --> 01:24:17,804
-+Vision, that's enough. Let him go.
-+
-+1154
-+01:24:18,722 --> 01:24:19,723
-+I'm leaving.
-+
-+1155
-+01:24:19,848 --> 01:24:20,974
-+I can't let you.
-+
-+1156
-+01:24:26,020 --> 01:24:27,355
-+I'm sorry.
-+
-+1157
-+01:24:30,859 --> 01:24:32,694
-+If you do this...
-+
-+1158
-+01:24:33,153 --> 01:24:36,156
-+they will never stop being afraid of you.
-+
-+1159
-+01:24:37,615 --> 01:24:40,952
-+I can't control their fear, only my own.
-+
-+1160
-+01:24:53,173 --> 01:24:54,424
-+Oh...
-+
-+1161
-+01:24:56,342 --> 01:24:58,803
-+Come on. We got one more stop.
-+
-+1162
-+01:24:59,637 --> 01:25:01,347
-+It's just a matter of time.
-+
-+1163
-+01:25:01,431 --> 01:25:04,184
-+Our satellites are running
-+facial, biometric,
-+
-+1164
-+01:25:04,267 --> 01:25:05,894
-+and behavioural pattern scans.
-+
-+1165
-+01:25:10,064 --> 01:25:12,609
-+Move or you will be moved.
-+
-+1166
-+01:25:13,902 --> 01:25:16,571
-+As entertaining as that would be...
-+
-+1167
-+01:25:16,738 --> 01:25:18,907
-+You really think you can find him?
-+
-+1168
-+01:25:19,407 --> 01:25:21,075
-+My resources are considerable.
-+
-+1169
-+01:25:21,242 --> 01:25:23,620
-+Yeah, it took the world
-+70 years to find Barnes...
-+
-+1170
-+01:25:23,703 --> 01:25:26,206
-+so you could probably do that
-+in about half the time.
-+
-+1171
-+01:25:27,415 --> 01:25:29,083
-+You know where they are.
-+
-+1172
-+01:25:29,250 --> 01:25:31,336
-+I know someone who does.
-+
-+1173
-+01:25:34,088 --> 01:25:36,633
-+Not sure you understand
-+the concept of a getaway car.
-+
-+1174
-+01:25:36,716 --> 01:25:37,717
-+It's low profile.
-+
-+1175
-+01:25:38,343 --> 01:25:41,095
-+Good, because this stuff
-+tends to draw a crowd.
-+
-+1176
-+01:25:42,931 --> 01:25:44,432
-+Can you move your seat up?
-+
-+1177
-+01:25:44,599 --> 01:25:45,725
-+No.
-+
-+1178
-+01:25:45,975 --> 01:25:47,018
-+I owe you again.
-+
-+1179
-+01:25:47,644 --> 01:25:49,229
-+Keeping a list.
-+
-+1180
-+01:25:52,357 --> 01:25:54,108
-+You know, he kinda tried to kill me.
-+
-+1181
-+01:25:55,026 --> 01:25:57,737
-+Sorry. I'll put it on the list, too.
-+
-+1182
-+01:26:01,074 --> 01:26:03,284
-+They're going to come looking for you.
-+
-+1183
-+01:26:03,368 --> 01:26:04,244
-+I know.
-+
-+1184
-+01:26:07,163 --> 01:26:08,540
-+Thank you, Sharon.
-+
-+1185
-+01:26:24,097 --> 01:26:25,098
-+That was...
-+
-+1186
-+01:26:25,265 --> 01:26:26,182
-+Late.
-+
-+1187
-+01:26:26,266 --> 01:26:27,100
-+Damn right.
-+
-+1188
-+01:26:31,771 --> 01:26:32,772
-+I should go.
-+
-+1189
-+01:26:32,939 --> 01:26:33,940
-+Okay.
-+
-+1190
-+01:26:58,506 --> 01:26:59,674
-+Cap.
-+
-+1191
-+01:26:59,841 --> 01:27:02,051
-+You know I wouldn't have called
-+if I had any other choice.
-+
-+1192
-+01:27:02,135 --> 01:27:03,511
-+Hey, man, you're doing me a favour.
-+
-+1193
-+01:27:03,678 --> 01:27:06,014
-+Besides, I owe a debt.
-+
-+1194
-+01:27:06,180 --> 01:27:07,724
-+Thanks for having my back.
-+
-+1195
-+01:27:07,891 --> 01:27:09,392
-+It was time to get off my ass.
-+
-+1196
-+01:27:09,976 --> 01:27:11,603
-+How about our other recruit?
-+
-+1197
-+01:27:11,769 --> 01:27:13,354
-+He's rarin' to go.
-+
-+1198
-+01:27:14,147 --> 01:27:15,356
-+Had to put a little coffee in him...
-+
-+1199
-+01:27:16,691 --> 01:27:17,817
-+but he should be good.
-+
-+1200
-+01:27:21,195 --> 01:27:22,697
-+What time zone is this?
-+
-+1201
-+01:27:22,864 --> 01:27:24,699
-+Come on. Come on.
-+
-+1202
-+01:27:27,827 --> 01:27:29,746
-+- Captain America!
-+- Mr Lang.
-+
-+1203
-+01:27:30,830 --> 01:27:31,831
-+It's an honour.
-+
-+1204
-+01:27:32,373 --> 01:27:34,083
-+I'm shaking your hand too long.
-+
-+1205
-+01:27:34,250 --> 01:27:35,501
-+Wow! This is awesome!
-+
-+1206
-+01:27:35,710 --> 01:27:38,296
-+Captain America.
-+I know you, too. You're great!
-+
-+1207
-+01:27:42,050 --> 01:27:43,051
-+Jeez.
-+
-+1208
-+01:27:43,217 --> 01:27:45,011
-+Ah, look, I wanna say,
-+
-+1209
-+01:27:45,094 --> 01:27:47,180
-+I know you know
-+a lot of super people, so...
-+
-+1210
-+01:27:48,139 --> 01:27:49,974
-+thinks for thanking of me.
-+
-+1211
-+01:27:50,224 --> 01:27:51,935
-+- Hey, man!
-+- What's up, Tic Tac?
-+
-+1212
-+01:27:52,185 --> 01:27:53,186
-+Uh, good to see you.
-+
-+1213
-+01:27:53,269 --> 01:27:54,729
-+Look, what happened last time when I...
-+
-+1214
-+01:27:54,938 --> 01:27:58,066
-+It was a great audition,
-+but it'll never happen again.
-+
-+1215
-+01:27:58,358 --> 01:28:00,526
-+They tell you what we're up against?
-+
-+1216
-+01:28:00,818 --> 01:28:03,905
-+Something about
-+some psycho-assassins?
-+
-+1217
-+01:28:04,364 --> 01:28:06,282
-+We're outside the law on this one.
-+
-+1218
-+01:28:06,366 --> 01:28:08,326
-+So if you come with us,
-+you're a wanted man.
-+
-+1219
-+01:28:08,868 --> 01:28:10,286
-+Yeah, well, what else is new?
-+
-+1220
-+01:28:10,536 --> 01:28:11,371
-+We should get moving.
-+
-+1221
-+01:28:11,579 --> 01:28:13,289
-+We got a chopper lined up.
-+
-+1222
-+01:28:17,919 --> 01:28:19,712
-+They're evacuating the airport.
-+
-+1223
-+01:28:19,879 --> 01:28:20,964
-+Stark.
-+
-+1224
-+01:28:21,047 --> 01:28:21,839
-+Stark?
-+
-+1225
-+01:28:23,508 --> 01:28:25,093
-+Suit up.
-+
-+1226
-+01:28:45,738 --> 01:28:47,824
-+<i>Wow, it's so weird
-+how you run into people at the airport.</i>
-+
-+1227
-+01:28:47,907 --> 01:28:49,534
-+- Don't you think that's weird?
-+<i>- Definitely weird.</i>
-+
-+1228
-+01:28:49,617 --> 01:28:50,910
-+Hear me out, Tony.
-+
-+1229
-+01:28:50,994 --> 01:28:54,038
-+That doctor, the psychiatrist,
-+he's behind all of this.
-+
-+1230
-+01:28:57,417 --> 01:28:58,501
-+<i>Captain.</i>
-+
-+1231
-+01:28:58,668 --> 01:28:59,460
-+Your Highness.
-+
-+1232
-+01:29:00,169 --> 01:29:01,170
-+Anyway...
-+
-+1233
-+01:29:01,587 --> 01:29:03,631
-+Ross gave me 36 hours to bring you in.
-+
-+1234
-+01:29:03,798 --> 01:29:06,718
-+That was 24 hours ago.
-+Can you help a brother out?
-+
-+1235
-+01:29:06,968 --> 01:29:08,302
-+You're after the wrong guy.
-+
-+1236
-+01:29:08,511 --> 01:29:10,430
-+Your judgement is askew.
-+
-+1237
-+01:29:11,097 --> 01:29:13,016
-+Your old war buddy killed
-+innocent people yesterday.
-+
-+1238
-+01:29:13,307 --> 01:29:16,102
-+And there are five more
-+super soldiers just like him.
-+
-+1239
-+01:29:16,185 --> 01:29:18,646
-+I can't let the doctor
-+find them first, Tony. I can't.
-+
-+1240
-+01:29:18,938 --> 01:29:19,981
-+Steve...
-+
-+1241
-+01:29:21,024 --> 01:29:23,026
-+you know what's about to happen.
-+
-+1242
-+01:29:23,109 --> 01:29:25,445
-+Do you really wanna
-+punch your way out of this one?
-+
-+1243
-+01:29:29,657 --> 01:29:31,534
-+All right, I've run out of patience.
-+
-+1244
-+01:29:31,617 --> 01:29:32,618
-+Underoos!
-+
-+1245
-+01:29:38,583 --> 01:29:40,418
-+- Nice job, kid.
-+- Thanks.
-+
-+1246
-+01:29:40,501 --> 01:29:42,336
-+I could have stuck the landing
-+a little better, it's just...
-+
-+1247
-+01:29:42,503 --> 01:29:44,338
-+New suit. It's nothing, Mr Stark.
-+
-+1248
-+01:29:44,505 --> 01:29:45,631
-+It's perfect. Thank you.
-+
-+1249
-+01:29:45,798 --> 01:29:47,467
-+Yeah, we don't really need
-+to start a conversation.
-+
-+1250
-+01:29:47,633 --> 01:29:48,718
-+Okay. Cap. Captain.
-+
-+1251
-+01:29:49,969 --> 01:29:51,137
-+Big fan. I'm Spider-Man.
-+
-+1252
-+01:29:51,387 --> 01:29:52,221
-+Yeah, we'll talk about it later.
-+
-+1253
-+01:29:52,430 --> 01:29:54,223
-+- Hey, everyone.
-+- Good job.
-+
-+1254
-+01:29:54,724 --> 01:29:55,725
-+You've been busy.
-+
-+1255
-+01:29:55,892 --> 01:29:57,935
-+And you've been a complete idiot.
-+
-+1256
-+01:29:58,019 --> 01:29:58,978
-+Dragging in Clint...
-+
-+1257
-+01:29:59,145 --> 01:30:00,605
-+"Rescuing" Wanda from a place
-+
-+1258
-+01:30:00,688 --> 01:30:02,815
-+she doesn't even want
-+to leave, a safe place.
-+
-+1259
-+01:30:02,982 --> 01:30:04,233
-+I'm trying to keep...
-+
-+1260
-+01:30:05,526 --> 01:30:08,529
-+I'm trying to keep you from
-+tearing the Avengers apart.
-+
-+1261
-+01:30:09,113 --> 01:30:11,324
-+You did that when you signed.
-+
-+1262
-+01:30:12,325 --> 01:30:13,493
-+All right, we're done.
-+
-+1263
-+01:30:14,202 --> 01:30:15,703
-+You're gonna turn Barnes over,
-+
-+1264
-+01:30:15,787 --> 01:30:17,955
-+you're gonna come with us,
-+now, because it's us...
-+
-+1265
-+01:30:18,498 --> 01:30:19,874
-+or a squad of J-SOC guys...
-+
-+1266
-+01:30:20,166 --> 01:30:22,668
-+with no compunction
-+about being impolite.
-+
-+1267
-+01:30:24,670 --> 01:30:25,838
-+Come on.
-+
-+1268
-+01:30:27,006 --> 01:30:28,549
-+<i>We found it.</i>
-+
-+1269
-+01:30:29,842 --> 01:30:31,928
-+Their Quinjet's in
-+hangar five, north runway.
-+
-+1270
-+01:30:36,140 --> 01:30:37,433
-+All right, Lang.
-+
-+1271
-+01:30:38,518 --> 01:30:40,269
-+Hey, guys, something...
-+
-+1272
-+01:30:40,686 --> 01:30:41,687
-+Whoa.
-+What the hell was that?
-+
-+1273
-+01:30:41,854 --> 01:30:43,856
-+<i>I believe this is yours, Captain America.</i>
-+
-+1274
-+01:30:44,023 --> 01:30:45,024
-+Oh, great.
-+
-+1275
-+01:30:45,191 --> 01:30:46,442
-+All right, there's two
-+on the parking deck.
-+
-+1276
-+01:30:46,526 --> 01:30:47,860
-+One of them's Maximoff,
-+I'm gonna grab her.
-+
-+1277
-+01:30:48,111 --> 01:30:49,529
-+<i>Rhodey, you wanna take Cap?</i>
-+
-+1278
-+01:30:49,737 --> 01:30:51,739
-+<i>Got two in the terminal,
-+Wilson and Barnes.</i>
-+
-+1279
-+01:30:51,906 --> 01:30:52,740
-+<i>Barnes is mine.</i>
-+
-+1280
-+01:30:54,283 --> 01:30:55,618
-+Hey, Mr Stark, what should I do?
-+
-+1281
-+01:30:55,868 --> 01:30:56,702
-+What we discussed.
-+
-+1282
-+01:30:56,786 --> 01:30:57,662
-+Keep your distance, web them up.
-+
-+1283
-+01:30:57,870 --> 01:30:59,080
-+Okay, copy that.
-+
-+1284
-+01:31:03,960 --> 01:31:05,461
-+<i>Move, Captain.</i>
-+
-+1285
-+01:31:05,711 --> 01:31:07,296
-+<i>I won't ask a second time.</i>
-+
-+1286
-+01:31:09,632 --> 01:31:11,092
-+<i>Look, I really don't want to hurt you.</i>
-+
-+1287
-+01:31:11,759 --> 01:31:13,177
-+I wouldn't stress about it.
-+
-+1288
-+01:31:25,398 --> 01:31:26,732
-+What the hell is that?
-+
-+1289
-+01:31:26,899 --> 01:31:28,985
-+Everyone's got a gimmick now.
-+
-+1290
-+01:31:35,533 --> 01:31:36,909
-+You have a metal arm?
-+
-+1291
-+01:31:37,076 --> 01:31:38,619
-+That is awesome, dude.
-+
-+1292
-+01:31:40,371 --> 01:31:41,747
-+You have the right to remain silent!
-+
-+1293
-+01:31:56,596 --> 01:31:57,930
-+<i>Sorry, Cap, this won't kill you...</i>
-+
-+1294
-+01:31:58,055 --> 01:31:59,223
-+but it ain't gonna tickle either.
-+
-+1295
-+01:32:04,604 --> 01:32:06,522
-+<i>Wanda, I think you hurt
-+Vision's feelings.</i>
-+
-+1296
-+01:32:06,689 --> 01:32:08,107
-+You locked me in my room.
-+
-+1297
-+01:32:08,316 --> 01:32:09,734
-+<i>Okay, first, that's an exaggeration.</i>
-+
-+1298
-+01:32:09,817 --> 01:32:12,153
-+<i>Second, I did it to protect you.</i>
-+
-+1299
-+01:32:12,403 --> 01:32:13,613
-+<i>- Hey, Clint.</i>
-+- Hey, man.
-+
-+1300
-+01:32:13,821 --> 01:32:15,448
-+<i>Clearly, retirement doesn't suit you.</i>
-+
-+1301
-+01:32:15,698 --> 01:32:17,158
-+<i>You got tired of shooting golf?</i>
-+
-+1302
-+01:32:17,325 --> 01:32:19,702
-+Well, I played 18, shot 18.
-+
-+1303
-+01:32:20,620 --> 01:32:21,829
-+Just can't seem to miss.
-+
-+1304
-+01:32:24,457 --> 01:32:25,750
-+<i>First time for everything.</i>
-+
-+1305
-+01:32:25,917 --> 01:32:26,792
-+Made you look.
-+
-+1306
-+01:32:37,470 --> 01:32:39,180
-+<i>Multiple contusions detected.</i>
-+
-+1307
-+01:32:39,347 --> 01:32:40,973
-+Yeah, I detected that, too.
-+
-+1308
-+01:32:48,856 --> 01:32:49,899
-+Oh, God!
-+
-+1309
-+01:32:51,192 --> 01:32:52,818
-+Hey, buddy, I think you lost this!
-+
-+1310
-+01:32:58,366 --> 01:32:59,533
-+Ahh!
-+
-+1311
-+01:33:04,914 --> 01:33:06,207
-+Those wings carbon fibre?
-+
-+1312
-+01:33:06,415 --> 01:33:07,667
-+Is this stuff coming out of you?
-+
-+1313
-+01:33:07,959 --> 01:33:09,460
-+That would explain
-+the rigidity-flexibility ratio,
-+
-+1314
-+01:33:09,543 --> 01:33:10,962
-+which, gotta say, that's awesome, man.
-+
-+1315
-+01:33:11,128 --> 01:33:12,713
-+I don't know if you've
-+been in a fight before...
-+
-+1316
-+01:33:12,880 --> 01:33:14,382
-+but there's usually not this much talking.
-+
-+1317
-+01:33:14,632 --> 01:33:15,675
-+All right, sorry. My bad.
-+
-+1318
-+01:33:20,763 --> 01:33:22,390
-+Guys, look, I'd love to keep this up,
-+
-+1319
-+01:33:22,473 --> 01:33:24,100
-+but I've only got one job here today...
-+
-+1320
-+01:33:24,350 --> 01:33:27,311
-+and I gotta impress Mr Stark,
-+so, I'm really sorry.
-+
-+1321
-+01:33:30,940 --> 01:33:32,942
-+You couldn't have done that earlier?
-+
-+1322
-+01:33:33,401 --> 01:33:34,568
-+I hate you.
-+
-+1323
-+01:33:41,158 --> 01:33:42,159
-+<i>Great.</i>
-+
-+1324
-+01:33:42,368 --> 01:33:43,744
-+<i>Hey, Cap, heads-up!</i>
-+
-+1325
-+01:33:45,454 --> 01:33:46,831
-+<i>Throw it at this.</i>
-+
-+1326
-+01:33:47,415 --> 01:33:48,457
-+<i>Now!</i>
-+
-+1327
-+01:33:51,961 --> 01:33:53,254
-+<i>Oh, come on!</i>
-+
-+1328
-+01:33:56,215 --> 01:33:59,010
-+<i>Oh, man, I thought it was a water truck.</i>
-+
-+1329
-+01:33:59,719 --> 01:34:01,053
-+<i>Uh, sorry.</i>
-+
-+1330
-+01:34:03,055 --> 01:34:04,390
-+<i>All right, now I'm pissed.</i>
-+
-+1331
-+01:34:05,349 --> 01:34:06,684
-+Is this part of the plan?
-+
-+1332
-+01:34:06,851 --> 01:34:08,394
-+<i>Well, my plan was go easy on them.</i>
-+
-+1333
-+01:34:08,477 --> 01:34:09,562
-+<i>You wanna switch it up?</i>
-+
-+1334
-+01:34:12,023 --> 01:34:12,982
-+There's our ride.
-+
-+1335
-+01:34:15,484 --> 01:34:16,485
-+Come on!
-+
-+1336
-+01:34:25,453 --> 01:34:26,537
-+Captain Rogers...
-+
-+1337
-+01:34:27,580 --> 01:34:30,583
-+I know you believe
-+what you're doing is right.
-+
-+1338
-+01:34:31,375 --> 01:34:33,210
-+But for the collective good...
-+
-+1339
-+01:34:33,377 --> 01:34:35,713
-+you must surrender now.
-+
-+1340
-+01:34:52,813 --> 01:34:54,440
-+What do we do, Cap?
-+
-+1341
-+01:34:55,441 --> 01:34:56,901
-+We fight.
-+
-+1342
-+01:34:58,486 --> 01:35:00,112
-+This is gonna end well.
-+
-+1343
-+01:35:06,869 --> 01:35:08,287
-+They're not stopping.
-+
-+1344
-+01:35:08,454 --> 01:35:09,163
-+Neither are we.
-+
-+1345
-+01:35:40,444 --> 01:35:41,570
-+We're still friends, right?
-+
-+1346
-+01:35:41,737 --> 01:35:43,197
-+Depends on how hard you hit me.
-+
-+1347
-+01:35:52,081 --> 01:35:54,041
-+You were pulling your punches.
-+
-+1348
-+01:35:58,462 --> 01:35:59,672
-+I didn't kill your father.
-+
-+1349
-+01:35:59,922 --> 01:36:01,549
-+<i>Then why did you run?</i>
-+
-+1350
-+01:36:19,733 --> 01:36:21,777
-+That thing does not obey
-+the laws of physics at all.
-+
-+1351
-+01:36:22,027 --> 01:36:23,696
-+Look, kid, there's a lot going on here
-+that you don't understand.
-+
-+1352
-+01:36:23,988 --> 01:36:25,573
-+Mr Stark said you'd say that. Wow.
-+
-+1353
-+01:36:35,082 --> 01:36:37,126
-+He also said to go for your legs.
-+
-+1354
-+01:36:44,592 --> 01:36:45,593
-+Ahhh!
-+
-+1355
-+01:36:48,888 --> 01:36:50,222
-+Clint, can you get him off me?
-+
-+1356
-+01:36:50,389 --> 01:36:51,557
-+Buckled in?
-+
-+1357
-+01:36:51,724 --> 01:36:53,142
-+<i>Yeah. No, I'm good.</i>
-+
-+1358
-+01:36:53,309 --> 01:36:55,352
-+<i>I'm good, Arrow Guy. Let's go!</i>
-+
-+1359
-+01:37:17,082 --> 01:37:18,459
-+Stark tell you anything else?
-+
-+1360
-+01:37:18,626 --> 01:37:21,504
-+That you're wrong.
-+You think you're right.
-+
-+1361
-+01:37:21,921 --> 01:37:23,297
-+That makes you dangerous.
-+
-+1362
-+01:37:28,302 --> 01:37:29,720
-+Guess he had a point.
-+
-+1363
-+01:37:34,808 --> 01:37:36,936
-+You got heart, kid. Where you from?
-+
-+1364
-+01:37:37,603 --> 01:37:38,812
-+Queens.
-+
-+1365
-+01:37:40,439 --> 01:37:41,440
-+Brooklyn.
-+
-+1366
-+01:37:47,404 --> 01:37:48,447
-+<i>Friday?</i>
-+
-+1367
-+01:37:48,531 --> 01:37:49,740
-+<i>We have some
-+weapon systems offline.</i>
-+
-+1368
-+01:37:49,823 --> 01:37:50,824
-+What?
-+
-+1369
-+01:37:51,158 --> 01:37:53,410
-+<i>Oh, you're gonna have to
-+take this into the shop.</i>
-+
-+1370
-+01:37:53,702 --> 01:37:55,037
-+Who's speaking?
-+
-+1371
-+01:37:55,204 --> 01:37:58,916
-+<i>It's your conscience.
-+We don't talk a lot these days.</i>
-+
-+1372
-+01:37:59,124 --> 01:38:00,125
-+Friday?
-+
-+1373
-+01:38:00,209 --> 01:38:01,502
-+<i>Deploying fire
-+suppression system.</i>
-+
-+1374
-+01:38:02,670 --> 01:38:03,671
-+<i>Uh-oh.</i>
-+
-+1375
-+01:38:05,631 --> 01:38:06,632
-+<i>Oh, boy!</i>
-+
-+1376
-+01:38:09,343 --> 01:38:10,344
-+<i>Whoa!</i>
-+
-+1377
-+01:38:15,975 --> 01:38:18,060
-+We gotta go.
-+That guy's probably in Siberia by now.
-+
-+1378
-+01:38:18,352 --> 01:38:19,603
-+We gotta draw out the flyers.
-+
-+1379
-+01:38:19,770 --> 01:38:21,522
-+I'll take Vision, you get to the jet.
-+
-+1380
-+01:38:21,814 --> 01:38:23,440
-+No, you get to the jet!
-+
-+1381
-+01:38:23,566 --> 01:38:24,358
-+<i>Both of you!</i>
-+
-+1382
-+01:38:26,986 --> 01:38:28,320
-+The rest of us aren't getting out of here.
-+
-+1383
-+01:38:28,487 --> 01:38:29,488
-+As much as I hate to admit it...
-+
-+1384
-+01:38:29,655 --> 01:38:31,115
-+<i>if we're gonna win this one,</i>
-+
-+1385
-+01:38:31,198 --> 01:38:32,783
-+<i>some of us might have to lose it.</i>
-+
-+1386
-+01:38:32,950 --> 01:38:34,994
-+<i>This isn't the real fight, Steve.</i>
-+
-+1387
-+01:38:35,160 --> 01:38:36,704
-+All right, Sam. What's the play?
-+
-+1388
-+01:38:36,996 --> 01:38:39,081
-+We need a diversion. Something big.
-+
-+1389
-+01:38:40,833 --> 01:38:42,459
-+<i>I got something kinda big.</i>
-+
-+1390
-+01:38:42,543 --> 01:38:43,877
-+<i>But I can't hold it very long.</i>
-+
-+1391
-+01:38:44,295 --> 01:38:46,297
-+<i>On my signal, run like hell.</i>
-+
-+1392
-+01:38:46,505 --> 01:38:49,091
-+<i>And if I tear myself in half...
-+don't come back for me.</i>
-+
-+1393
-+01:38:49,174 --> 01:38:50,050
-+He's gonna tear himself in half?
-+
-+1394
-+01:38:50,342 --> 01:38:51,802
-+You sure about this, Scott?
-+
-+1395
-+01:38:52,011 --> 01:38:53,345
-+<i>I do it all the time.</i>
-+
-+1396
-+01:38:53,554 --> 01:38:55,347
-+<i>I mean, once. In a lab.</i>
-+
-+1397
-+01:38:55,514 --> 01:38:57,182
-+<i>Then I passed out.</i>
-+
-+1398
-+01:38:57,349 --> 01:38:59,184
-+<i>I'm the boss, I'm the boss, I'm the boss.</i>
-+
-+1399
-+01:39:15,242 --> 01:39:16,744
-+Holy shit!
-+
-+1400
-+01:39:21,040 --> 01:39:22,916
-+Okay, tiny dude is big now.
-+He's big now.
-+
-+1401
-+01:39:24,960 --> 01:39:26,045
-+I guess that's the signal.
-+
-+1402
-+01:39:26,295 --> 01:39:27,755
-+Way to go, Tic Tac!
-+
-+1403
-+01:39:29,632 --> 01:39:31,050
-+Give me back my Rhodey.
-+
-+1404
-+01:39:34,720 --> 01:39:35,929
-+I got him.
-+
-+1405
-+01:39:58,577 --> 01:40:01,121
-+Okay, anybody on our side
-+hiding any shocking
-+
-+1406
-+01:40:01,205 --> 01:40:02,915
-+and fantastic abilities
-+they'd like to disclose...
-+
-+1407
-+01:40:03,082 --> 01:40:04,208
-+I'm open to suggestions.
-+
-+1408
-+01:40:12,341 --> 01:40:13,967
-+<i>You wanna get to them...</i>
-+
-+1409
-+01:40:14,134 --> 01:40:15,260
-+<i>you gotta go through me.</i>
-+
-+1410
-+01:40:26,230 --> 01:40:27,356
-+<i>Uh-huh.</i>
-+
-+1411
-+01:40:42,287 --> 01:40:43,747
-+We haven't met yet.
-+
-+1412
-+01:40:46,333 --> 01:40:47,960
-+- I'm Clint.
-+<i>- I don't care.</i>
-+
-+1413
-+01:41:02,182 --> 01:41:03,225
-+Whoa!
-+
-+1414
-+01:41:08,272 --> 01:41:09,273
-+Ahhh!
-+
-+1415
-+01:41:15,863 --> 01:41:16,822
-+Get off!
-+
-+1416
-+01:41:31,754 --> 01:41:33,464
-+<i>Something just flew in me!</i>
-+
-+1417
-+01:41:57,696 --> 01:41:58,530
-+You're not gonna stop.
-+
-+1418
-+01:41:59,364 --> 01:42:00,365
-+You know I can't.
-+
-+1419
-+01:42:01,325 --> 01:42:02,451
-+I'm gonna regret this.
-+
-+1420
-+01:42:06,121 --> 01:42:07,414
-+Go.
-+
-+1421
-+01:42:13,086 --> 01:42:15,130
-+Hey, guys, you ever see
-+that really old movie,
-+
-+1422
-+01:42:15,214 --> 01:42:17,132
-+<i>Empire Strikes Back?</i>
-+
-+1423
-+01:42:17,382 --> 01:42:18,717
-+<i>Jesus, Tony, how old is this guy?</i>
-+
-+1424
-+01:42:18,884 --> 01:42:19,927
-+I don't know, I didn't carbon-date him.
-+
-+1425
-+01:42:20,052 --> 01:42:21,053
-+He's on the young side.
-+
-+1426
-+01:42:23,096 --> 01:42:26,225
-+You know that part
-+where they're on the snow planet...
-+
-+1427
-+01:42:27,476 --> 01:42:28,977
-+with the walking thingies?
-+
-+1428
-+01:42:31,396 --> 01:42:32,439
-+Maybe the kid's onto something.
-+
-+1429
-+01:42:32,606 --> 01:42:33,565
-+High now, Tony. Go high.
-+
-+1430
-+01:42:42,074 --> 01:42:43,075
-+Yes!
-+
-+1431
-+01:42:43,617 --> 01:42:45,202
-+That was awesome!
-+
-+1432
-+01:42:59,925 --> 01:43:02,928
-+Does anyone have any orange slices?
-+
-+1433
-+01:43:08,475 --> 01:43:09,476
-+Kid, you all right?
-+
-+1434
-+01:43:09,685 --> 01:43:10,686
-+Whoa!
-+
-+1435
-+01:43:11,603 --> 01:43:14,690
-+Same side. Guess who. Hi. It's me.
-+
-+1436
-+01:43:14,857 --> 01:43:15,941
-+- Hey, man.
-+- Yeah.
-+
-+1437
-+01:43:16,108 --> 01:43:17,317
-+- That was scary.
-+- Yeah.
-+
-+1438
-+01:43:17,484 --> 01:43:19,111
-+You're done, all right?
-+
-+1439
-+01:43:19,278 --> 01:43:20,237
-+What? I'm good, I'm fine.
-+
-+1440
-+01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:21,363
-+You did a good job. Stay down.
-+
-+1441
-+01:43:21,446 --> 01:43:22,614
-+No, it's good. I gotta get him back.
-+
-+1442
-+01:43:22,781 --> 01:43:23,782
-+You're going home or I'll call Aunt May!
-+
-+1443
-+01:43:23,949 --> 01:43:25,117
-+- Dude.
-+- You're done!
-+
-+1444
-+01:43:25,284 --> 01:43:26,326
-+Wait.
-+
-+1445
-+01:43:26,493 --> 01:43:29,496
-+Mr Stark, wait.
-+I'm not done. I'm not...
-+
-+1446
-+01:43:31,665 --> 01:43:33,959
-+Okay, I'm done. I'm done.
-+
-+1447
-+01:43:50,142 --> 01:43:52,352
-+I said
-+I'd help you find him, not catch him.
-+
-+1448
-+01:43:52,895 --> 01:43:54,479
-+There's a difference.
-+
-+1449
-+01:44:01,320 --> 01:44:02,154
-+I'm sorry.
-+
-+1450
-+01:44:02,905 --> 01:44:03,989
-+Me, too.
-+
-+1451
-+01:44:04,907 --> 01:44:05,866
-+It's as I said.
-+
-+1452
-+01:44:06,408 --> 01:44:08,076
-+Catastrophe.
-+
-+1453
-+01:44:21,006 --> 01:44:22,841
-+Vision, I got a bandit on my six.
-+
-+1454
-+01:44:27,596 --> 01:44:28,597
-+<i>Vision! You copy?</i>
-+
-+1455
-+01:44:28,764 --> 01:44:30,766
-+<i>Target his thruster,
-+turn him into a glider.</i>
-+
-+1456
-+01:44:45,948 --> 01:44:47,074
-+<i>Rhodey!</i>
-+
-+1457
-+01:44:48,867 --> 01:44:50,661
-+Tony, I'm flying dead stick.
-+
-+1458
-+01:44:58,877 --> 01:45:00,253
-+Rhodes!
-+
-+1459
-+01:45:12,599 --> 01:45:14,059
-+Read vitals.
-+
-+1460
-+01:45:14,226 --> 01:45:15,477
-+<i>Heartbeat detected.</i>
-+
-+1461
-+01:45:15,644 --> 01:45:17,646
-+<i>Emergency medical is on its way.</i>
-+
-+1462
-+01:45:22,818 --> 01:45:23,735
-+I'm sorry.
-+
-+1463
-+01:45:45,716 --> 01:45:47,426
-+- this is room 201...
-+
-+1464
-+01:45:48,760 --> 01:45:50,387
-+Bacon and black coffee again today?
-+
-+1465
-+01:45:51,763 --> 01:45:53,306
-+You know me so well...
-+
-+1466
-+01:45:54,933 --> 01:45:56,768
-+Hello? Your breakfast is here.
-+
-+1467
-+01:45:57,769 --> 01:45:58,770
-+May I let myself in?
-+
-+1468
-+01:46:23,837 --> 01:46:25,464
-+What's gonna happen to your friends?
-+
-+1469
-+01:46:34,056 --> 01:46:35,599
-+Whatever it is...
-+
-+1470
-+01:46:36,183 --> 01:46:37,809
-+I'll deal with it.
-+
-+1471
-+01:46:40,896 --> 01:46:42,731
-+I don't know if I'm worth all this, Steve.
-+
-+1472
-+01:46:50,197 --> 01:46:51,823
-+What you did all those years...
-+
-+1473
-+01:46:52,866 --> 01:46:54,367
-+It wasn't you.
-+
-+1474
-+01:46:55,202 --> 01:46:56,995
-+You didn't have a choice.
-+
-+1475
-+01:46:58,163 --> 01:46:59,790
-+I know.
-+
-+1476
-+01:47:02,375 --> 01:47:04,586
-+But I did it.
-+
-+1477
-+01:47:18,809 --> 01:47:20,936
-+How did this happen?
-+
-+1478
-+01:47:21,144 --> 01:47:23,146
-+I became distracted.
-+
-+1479
-+01:47:25,440 --> 01:47:27,567
-+I didn't think that was possible.
-+
-+1480
-+01:47:28,985 --> 01:47:30,654
-+Neither did I.
-+
-+1481
-+01:47:47,212 --> 01:47:50,215
-+The doctors say
-+he shattered L4 through S1.
-+
-+1482
-+01:47:50,382 --> 01:47:53,135
-+Extreme laceration to the spinal cord.
-+
-+1483
-+01:47:53,301 --> 01:47:55,929
-+Probably looking at
-+some form of paralysis.
-+
-+1484
-+01:47:59,266 --> 01:48:00,809
-+Steve's not gonna stop.
-+
-+1485
-+01:48:01,601 --> 01:48:02,644
-+If you don't either,
-+
-+1486
-+01:48:02,727 --> 01:48:03,895
-+Rhodey's gonna be
-+the best case scenario.
-+
-+1487
-+01:48:04,146 --> 01:48:05,313
-+You let them go, Nat.
-+
-+1488
-+01:48:05,480 --> 01:48:06,523
-+We played this wrong.
-+
-+1489
-+01:48:06,690 --> 01:48:07,941
-+"We"?
-+
-+1490
-+01:48:08,400 --> 01:48:09,442
-+Boy, it must be hard to
-+
-+1491
-+01:48:09,526 --> 01:48:10,569
-+shake the whole
-+double agent thing, huh?
-+
-+1492
-+01:48:11,111 --> 01:48:12,821
-+It sticks in the DNA.
-+
-+1493
-+01:48:14,239 --> 01:48:16,825
-+Are you incapable
-+of letting go of your ego...
-+
-+1494
-+01:48:17,117 --> 01:48:19,077
-+for one goddamn second?
-+
-+1495
-+01:48:23,415 --> 01:48:25,625
-+T'Challa told Ross what you did, so...
-+
-+1496
-+01:48:26,960 --> 01:48:28,587
-+they're coming for you.
-+
-+1497
-+01:48:29,629 --> 01:48:32,382
-+I'm not the one that needs
-+to watch their back.
-+
-+1498
-+01:48:41,016 --> 01:48:42,392
-+What am I looking at, Friday?
-+
-+1499
-+01:48:42,475 --> 01:48:44,853
-+<i>Priority upload
-+from Berlin police.</i>
-+
-+1500
-+01:48:47,898 --> 01:48:49,399
-+Fire up the chopper.
-+
-+1501
-+01:48:55,363 --> 01:48:57,157
-+<i>The Task Force
-+called for a psychiatrist</i>
-+
-+1502
-+01:48:57,324 --> 01:48:58,950
-+<i>as soon as Barnes was captured.</i>
-+
-+1503
-+01:48:59,159 --> 01:49:01,453
-+<i>The UN dispatched
-+Doctor Theo Broussard</i>
-+
-+1504
-+01:49:01,578 --> 01:49:02,913
-+<i>from Geneva within the hour.</i>
-+
-+1505
-+01:49:03,079 --> 01:49:04,748
-+<i>He was met by this man.</i>
-+
-+1506
-+01:49:04,915 --> 01:49:05,916
-+Did you run
-+facial recognition yet?
-+
-+1507
-+01:49:05,999 --> 01:49:07,000
-+<i>What do I look like?</i>
-+
-+1508
-+01:49:07,417 --> 01:49:09,294
-+Uh, I don't know.
-+I've been picturing a redhead.
-+
-+1509
-+01:49:09,461 --> 01:49:11,004
-+<i>You must be thinking of someone else.</i>
-+
-+1510
-+01:49:11,129 --> 01:49:12,172
-+Must be.
-+
-+1511
-+01:49:12,339 --> 01:49:15,008
-+<i>The fake doctor is actually
-+Colonel Helmut Zemo.</i>

-+<i>a Sokovian covert kill squad.</i>
-+
-+1515
-+01:49:26,311 --> 01:49:27,812
-+What happened to the real Broussard?
-+
-+1516
-+01:49:27,896 --> 01:49:29,773
-+<i>He was found dead
-+in a Berlin hotel room.</i>

-+Son of a bitch.
-+
-+1520

-+- Get this to Ross.
-+<i>- Yes, boss.</i>

-+<i>This is Raft Prison Control.</i>

-+1522

-+<i>You're cleared for landing, Mr Stark.</i>
-+
-+1523
-+01:51:54,209 --> 01:51:56,169
-+So? You got the files?
-+
-+1524
-+01:51:56,419 --> 01:51:57,587
-+Let's reroute the satellites,
-+
-+1525
-+01:51:57,754 --> 01:51:59,672
-+start facial scanning for this Zemo guy.
-+
-+1526
-+01:51:59,839 --> 01:52:01,925
-+You seriously think
-+I'm gonna listen to you
-+
-+1527
-+01:52:02,300 --> 01:52:04,135
-+after that fiasco in Leipzig?
-+
-+1528
-+01:52:04,344 --> 01:52:06,638
-+You're lucky you're not
-+in one of these cells.
-+
-+1529
-+01:52:37,460 --> 01:52:40,088
-+The Futurist, gentlemen!
-+
-+1530
-+01:52:40,255 --> 01:52:42,715
-+The Futurist is here!
-+
-+1531
-+01:52:42,882 --> 01:52:44,175
-+He sees all!
-+
-+1532
-+01:52:45,176 --> 01:52:48,263
-+He knows what's best for you,
-+whether you like it or not.
-+
-+1533
-+01:52:48,847 --> 01:52:49,848
-+Give me a break, Barton.
-+
-+1534
-+01:52:50,098 --> 01:52:52,559
-+<i>I had no idea
-+they'd put you here. Come on.</i>
-+
-+1535
-+01:52:53,184 --> 01:52:55,854
-+Yeah, well, you knew
-+they'd put us somewhere, Tony.
-+
-+1536
-+01:52:56,062 --> 01:52:59,190
-+Yeah, but not some
-+super-max floating ocean pokey.
-+
-+1537
-+01:52:59,357 --> 01:53:01,734
-+This place is for maniacs.
-+This is a place for...
-+
-+1538
-+01:53:01,901 --> 01:53:03,194
-+Criminals?
-+
-+1539
-+01:53:04,404 --> 01:53:06,197
-+Criminals, Tony.
-+
-+1540
-+01:53:06,698 --> 01:53:09,033
-+Think that's the word you're looking for.
-+
-+1541
-+01:53:10,326 --> 01:53:11,369
-+Right?
-+
-+1542
-+01:53:11,995 --> 01:53:14,038
-+That didn't used to mean me.
-+
-+1543
-+01:53:14,247 --> 01:53:15,665
-+Or Sam, or Wanda.
-+
-+1544
-+01:53:15,915 --> 01:53:17,459
-+But here we are.
-+
-+1545
-+01:53:17,625 --> 01:53:19,294
-+- Because you broke the law.
-+- Yeah.
-+
-+1546
-+01:53:19,461 --> 01:53:20,462
-+I didn't make you.
-+
-+1547
-+01:53:21,921 --> 01:53:23,465
-+- La, la, la, la, la...
-+- You read it, you broke it.
-+
-+1548
-+01:53:25,049 --> 01:53:27,218
-+You're all grown up,
-+you got a wife and kids.
-+
-+1549
-+01:53:27,343 --> 01:53:28,636
-+I don't understand, why didn't you
-+
-+1550
-+01:53:28,720 --> 01:53:30,638
-+think about them before
-+you chose the wrong side?
-+
-+1551
-+01:53:31,764 --> 01:53:33,725
-+You gotta watch your back with this guy.
-+
-+1552
-+01:53:35,018 --> 01:53:37,145
-+There's a chance he's gonna break it.
-+
-+1553
-+01:53:38,646 --> 01:53:41,858
-+Hank Pym always said
-+you never can trust a Stark.
-+
-+1554
-+01:53:42,692 --> 01:53:44,110
-+Who are you?
-+
-+1555
-+01:53:44,861 --> 01:53:46,529
-+Come on, man.
-+
-+1556
-+01:53:48,031 --> 01:53:49,073
-+How's Rhodes?
-+
-+1557
-+01:53:49,240 --> 01:53:52,076
-+They're flying him to
-+Columbia Medical tomorrow...
-+
-+1558
-+01:53:52,160 --> 01:53:53,328
-+so fingers crossed.
-+
-+1559
-+01:53:54,996 --> 01:53:56,456
-+What do you need? They feed you yet?
-+
-+1560
-+01:53:58,666 --> 01:54:00,168
-+You're the good cop, now?
-+
-+1561
-+01:54:00,877 --> 01:54:02,670
-+I'm just the guy who needs
-+to know where Steve went.
-+
-+1562
-+01:54:02,837 --> 01:54:04,422
-+Well, you better go get a bad cop...
-+
-+1563
-+01:54:04,589 --> 01:54:06,633
-+because you're gonna have to
-+go Mark Fuhrman on my ass...
-+
-+1564
-+01:54:06,799 --> 01:54:08,718
-+to get information out of me.
-+
-+1565
-+01:54:08,968 --> 01:54:10,845
-+Well, I just knocked
-+the A out of their AV.
-+
-+1566
-+01:54:11,054 --> 01:54:13,932
-+We got about 30 seconds before
-+they realise it's not their equipment.
-+
-+1567
-+01:54:14,891 --> 01:54:15,934
-+What'd you do?
-+
-+1568
-+01:54:16,100 --> 01:54:17,644
-+Get it back up!
-+
-+1569
-+01:54:18,728 --> 01:54:19,270
-+Just look.
-+
-+1570
-+01:54:20,730 --> 01:54:22,148
-+Because that...
-+
-+1571
-+01:54:22,315 --> 01:54:24,317
-+is the fellow who was
-+supposed to interrogate Barnes.
-+
-+1572
-+01:54:26,027 --> 01:54:28,571
-+Clearly, I made a mistake.
-+Sam, I was wrong.
-+
-+1573
-+01:54:28,863 --> 01:54:30,281
-+That's a first.
-+
-+1574
-+01:54:30,365 --> 01:54:31,991
-+Cap is definitely off the reservation...
-+
-+1575
-+01:54:32,075 --> 01:54:33,576
-+but he's about to need
-+all the help he can get.
-+
-+1576
-+01:54:34,118 --> 01:54:35,161
-+We don't know each other very well.
-+
-+1577
-+01:54:35,245 --> 01:54:36,329
-+You don't have to...
-+
-+1578
-+01:54:36,412 --> 01:54:38,623
-+Hey, it's all right.
-+
-+1579
-+01:54:46,548 --> 01:54:48,174
-+Look, I'll tell you...
-+
-+1580
-+01:54:48,341 --> 01:54:51,177
-+but you have to go alone and as a friend.
-+
-+1581
-+01:54:52,971 --> 01:54:54,013
-+Easy.
-+
-+1582
-+01:54:56,975 --> 01:54:57,976
-+Stark?
-+
-+1583
-+01:54:58,601 --> 01:55:00,270
-+Did he give you anything on Rogers?
-+
-+1584
-+01:55:00,436 --> 01:55:01,437
-+Nope. Told me to go to hell.
-+
-+1585
-+01:55:01,604 --> 01:55:03,439
-+I'm going back to the compound instead,
-+
-+1586
-+01:55:03,565 --> 01:55:05,525
-+but you can call me anytime.
-+
-+1587
-+01:55:05,692 --> 01:55:07,193
-+I'll put you on hold.
-+I like to watch the line blink.
-+
-+1588
-+01:56:16,888 --> 01:56:18,264
-+You remember that time
-+we had to ride back
-+
-+1589
-+01:56:18,514 --> 01:56:20,725
-+from Rockaway Beach
-+in the back of that freezer truck?
-+
-+1590
-+01:56:20,808 --> 01:56:23,061
-+Was that the time
-+we used our train money
-+
-+1591
-+01:56:23,144 --> 01:56:24,312
-+to buy hot dogs?
-+
-+1592
-+01:56:24,395 --> 01:56:27,482
-+You blew three bucks trying to win
-+that stuffed bear for a redhead.
-+
-+1593
-+01:56:28,191 --> 01:56:29,192
-+What was her name, again?
-+
-+1594
-+01:56:29,400 --> 01:56:31,110
-+Dolores. You called her Dot.
-+
-+1595
-+01:56:31,653 --> 01:56:33,363
-+She's gotta be
-+a hundred years old right now.
-+
-+1596
-+01:56:33,571 --> 01:56:34,614
-+So are we, pal.
-+
-+1597
-+01:56:44,457 --> 01:56:46,542
-+He can't have
-+been here more than a few hours.
-+
-+1598
-+01:56:46,709 --> 01:56:48,711
-+Long enough to wake them up.
-+
-+1599
-+01:57:30,878 --> 01:57:31,879
-+You ready?
-+
-+1600
-+01:57:32,046 --> 01:57:33,047
-+Yeah.
-+
-+1601
-+01:57:46,644 --> 01:57:48,646
-+You seem a little defensive.
-+
-+1602
-+01:57:49,981 --> 01:57:51,149
-+It's been a long day.
-+
-+1603
-+01:57:51,941 --> 01:57:53,776
-+At ease, Soldier.
-+I'm not currently after you.
-+
-+1604
-+01:57:53,943 --> 01:57:55,153
-+Then why are you here?
-+
-+1605
-+01:57:56,237 --> 01:57:58,906
-+Could be your story's not so crazy.
-+
-+1606
-+01:57:59,073 --> 01:57:59,949
-+Maybe.
-+
-+1607
-+01:58:01,701 --> 01:58:04,495
-+Ross has no idea I'm here.
-+I'd like to keep it that way.
-+
-+1608
-+01:58:05,580 --> 01:58:07,582
-+Otherwise, I gotta arrest myself.
-+
-+1609
-+01:58:08,875 --> 01:58:10,460
-+Well, that sounds like a lot of paperwork.
-+
-+1610
-+01:58:14,213 --> 01:58:15,506
-+It's good to see you, Tony.
-+
-+1611
-+01:58:15,715 --> 01:58:16,549
-+You too, Cap.
-+
-+1612
-+01:58:17,842 --> 01:58:20,094
-+Hey, Manchurian Candidate,
-+you're killing me.
-+
-+1613
-+01:58:20,178 --> 01:58:22,180
-+There's a truce here. You can drop...
-+
-+1614
-+01:58:42,116 --> 01:58:43,451
-+<i>I got heat signatures.</i>
-+
-+1615
-+01:58:43,618 --> 01:58:45,077
-+How many?
-+
-+1616
-+01:58:46,120 --> 01:58:47,997
-+<i>Uh, one.</i>
-+
-+1617
-+01:59:06,641 --> 01:59:08,893
-+<i>If it's any comfort,</i>
-+
-+1618
-+01:59:09,018 --> 01:59:10,520
-+<i>they died in their sleep.</i>
-+
-+1619
-+01:59:17,568 --> 01:59:20,655
-+<i>Did you really think
-+I wanted more of you?</i>
-+
-+1620
-+01:59:21,823 --> 01:59:23,533
-+What the hell?
-+
-+1621
-+01:59:24,325 --> 01:59:26,118
-+<i>I'm grateful to them, though.</i>
-+
-+1622
-+01:59:27,203 --> 01:59:28,746
-+<i>They brought you here.</i>
-+
-+1623
-+01:59:33,459 --> 01:59:35,169
-+<i>Please, Captain.</i>
-+
-+1624
-+01:59:35,336 --> 01:59:37,129
-+<i>The Soviets built
-+this chamber to withstand</i>
-+
-+1625
-+01:59:37,213 --> 01:59:39,799
-+<i>the launch blast of UR-100 rockets.</i>
-+
-+1626
-+01:59:39,966 --> 01:59:41,759
-+<i>I'm betting I could beat that.</i>
-+
-+1627
-+01:59:41,926 --> 01:59:43,636
-+<i>Oh, I'm sure you could, Mr Stark.</i>
-+
-+1628
-+01:59:44,178 --> 01:59:45,680
-+<i>Given time.</i>
-+
-+1629
-+01:59:46,180 --> 01:59:47,765
-+<i>But then you'd never know
-+why you came.</i>
-+
-+1630
-+01:59:47,974 --> 01:59:50,434
-+You killed innocent people in Vienna
-+just to bring us here?
-+
-+1631
-+01:59:57,233 --> 02:00:00,862
-+I've thought about
-+nothing else for over a year.
-+
-+1632
-+02:00:01,529 --> 02:00:03,281
-+I studied you.
-+
-+1633
-+02:00:03,781 --> 02:00:05,199
-+I followed you.
-+
-+1634
-+02:00:05,825 --> 02:00:07,618
-+But now that you're standing here...
-+
-+1635
-+02:00:07,785 --> 02:00:09,787
-+I just realised...
-+
-+1636
-+02:00:11,956 --> 02:00:14,458
-+there's a bit of green
-+in the blue of your eyes.
-+
-+1637
-+02:00:16,878 --> 02:00:19,338
-+How nice to find a flaw.
-+
-+1638
-+02:00:19,922 --> 02:00:21,507
-+You're Sokovian.
-+
-+1639
-+02:00:22,675 --> 02:00:24,176
-+Is that what this is about?
-+
-+1640
-+02:00:24,343 --> 02:00:27,847
-+Sokovia was a failed state
-+long before you blew it to hell.
-+
-+1641
-+02:00:27,972 --> 02:00:29,098
-+No.
-+
-+1642
-+02:00:30,433 --> 02:00:33,394
-+I'm here because I made a promise.
-+
-+1643
-+02:00:36,606 --> 02:00:37,815
-+You lost someone?
-+
-+1644
-+02:00:41,694 --> 02:00:43,738
-+I lost everyone.
-+
-+1645
-+02:00:45,573 --> 02:00:47,158
-+And so will you.
-+
-+1646
-+02:00:53,456 --> 02:00:57,084
-+An empire toppled
-+by its enemies can rise again.
-+
-+1647
-+02:00:58,169 --> 02:01:00,296
-+But one which crumbles from within?
-+
-+1648
-+02:01:01,923 --> 02:01:03,424
-+That's dead.
-+
-+1649
-+02:01:04,550 --> 02:01:05,551
-+Forever.
-+
-+1650
-+02:01:14,393 --> 02:01:16,020
-+I know that road.
-+
-+1651
-+02:01:18,397 --> 02:01:19,398
-+What is this?
-+
-+1652
-+02:01:42,672 --> 02:01:44,298
-+<i>Help my wife.</i>
-+
-+1653
-+02:01:45,424 --> 02:01:47,718
-+<i>Please. Help.</i>
-+
-+1654
-+02:01:53,307 --> 02:01:54,392
-+<i>Sergeant Barnes?</i>
-+
-+1655
-+02:01:56,143 --> 02:01:57,478
-+<i>Howard!</i>
-+
-+1656
-+02:02:05,069 --> 02:02:06,112
-+<i>Howard!</i>
-+
-+1657
-+02:02:43,524 --> 02:02:45,109
-+No, Tony.
-+
-+1658
-+02:02:54,285 --> 02:02:55,494
-+Did you know?
-+
-+1659
-+02:02:57,997 --> 02:02:59,248
-+I didn't know it was him.
-+
-+1660
-+02:02:59,415 --> 02:03:01,834
-+Don't bullshit me, Rogers.
-+Did you know?
-+
-+1661
-+02:03:05,713 --> 02:03:06,756
-+Yes.
-+
-+1662
-+02:04:03,854 --> 02:04:05,189
-+Get out of here!
-+
-+1663
-+02:04:16,659 --> 02:04:17,368
-+It wasn't him, Tony.
-+
-+1664
-+02:04:17,535 --> 02:04:18,536
-+HYDRA had control of his mind!
-+
-+1665
-+02:04:18,661 --> 02:04:19,411
-+Move!
-+
-+1666
-+02:04:19,703 --> 02:04:20,704
-+It wasn't him!
-+
-+1667
-+02:04:29,713 --> 02:04:31,048
-+<i>Left bootjet failing.</i>
-+
-+1668
-+02:04:31,924 --> 02:04:34,051
-+<i>Flight systems compromised.</i>
-+
-+1669
-+02:04:34,760 --> 02:04:35,636
-+Ah, crap.
-+
-+1670
-+02:04:49,525 --> 02:04:51,235
-+He's not gonna stop. Go.
-+
-+1671
-+02:05:14,258 --> 02:05:15,259
-+Come on, come on.
-+
-+1672
-+02:05:15,426 --> 02:05:16,969
-+<i>Targeting system's
-+knackered, boss.</i>
-+
-+1673
-+02:05:17,178 --> 02:05:18,095
-+I'm eyeballing it.
-+
-+1674
-+02:05:36,780 --> 02:05:38,407
-+Do you even remember them?
-+
-+1675
-+02:05:38,574 --> 02:05:40,284
-+I remember all of them.
-+
-+1676
-+02:06:03,140 --> 02:06:05,142
-+This isn't gonna change what happened.
-+
-+1677
-+02:06:05,309 --> 02:06:06,810
-+I don't care.
-+
-+1678
-+02:06:07,353 --> 02:06:08,729
-+He killed my mom.
-+
-+1679
-+02:07:10,207 --> 02:07:11,792
-+<i>You should have
-+seen his little face.</i>
-+
-+1680
-+02:07:11,875 --> 02:07:13,544
-+<i>Just try, okay?</i>
-+
-+1681
-+02:07:13,711 --> 02:07:15,546
-+<i>I'm going to bed.</i>
-+
-+1682
-+02:07:15,713 --> 02:07:17,381
-+<i>I love you.</i>
-+
-+1683
-+02:07:25,347 --> 02:07:27,766
-+I almost
-+killed the wrong man.
-+
-+1684
-+02:07:28,892 --> 02:07:30,894
-+Hardly an innocent one.
-+
-+1685
-+02:07:31,061 --> 02:07:32,896
-+This is all you wanted?
-+
-+1686
-+02:07:33,731 --> 02:07:36,233
-+To see them rip each other apart.
-+
-+1687
-+02:07:40,195 --> 02:07:42,823
-+My father lived outside the city.
-+
-+1688
-+02:07:43,741 --> 02:07:46,076
-+I thought we would be safe there.
-+
-+1689
-+02:07:46,702 --> 02:07:48,579
-+My son was excited.
-+
-+1690
-+02:07:48,746 --> 02:07:51,582
-+He could see the Iron Man
-+from the car window.
-+
-+1691
-+02:07:52,583 --> 02:07:55,794
-+I told my wife, "Don't worry.
-+
-+1692
-+02:07:55,961 --> 02:07:59,923
-+"They're fighting in the city.
-+We're miles from harm."
-+
-+1693
-+02:08:02,259 --> 02:08:04,595
-+When the dust cleared...
-+
-+1694
-+02:08:05,429 --> 02:08:07,806
-+and the screaming stopped...
-+
-+1695
-+02:08:08,557 --> 02:08:12,478
-+it took me two days
-+until I found their bodies.
-+
-+1696
-+02:08:14,813 --> 02:08:16,398
-+My father...
-+
-+1697
-+02:08:17,232 --> 02:08:20,778
-+still holding my wife and son in his arms.
-+
-+1698
-+02:08:25,240 --> 02:08:27,242
-+And the Avengers?
-+
-+1699
-+02:08:28,243 --> 02:08:29,995
-+They went home.
-+
-+1700
-+02:08:31,955 --> 02:08:34,124
-+I knew I couldn't kill them.
-+
-+1701
-+02:08:34,291 --> 02:08:36,794
-+More powerful men than me have tried.
-+
-+1702
-+02:08:39,004 --> 02:08:41,256
-+<i>But, if I could get them
-+to kill each other...</i>
-+
-+1703
-+02:08:45,803 --> 02:08:48,597
-+I'm sorry about your father.
-+
-+1704
-+02:08:49,014 --> 02:08:50,849
-+He seemed a good man.
-+
-+1705
-+02:08:52,643 --> 02:08:54,144
-+With a dutiful son.
-+
-+1706
-+02:08:58,857 --> 02:09:00,651
-+Vengeance has consumed you.
-+
-+1707
-+02:09:03,445 --> 02:09:05,781
-+It's consuming them.
-+
-+1708
-+02:09:09,701 --> 02:09:11,787
-+I am done letting it consume me.
-+
-+1709
-+02:09:15,499 --> 02:09:17,835
-+Justice will come soon enough.
-+
-+1710
-+02:09:21,171 --> 02:09:23,006
-+Tell that to the dead.
-+
-+1711
-+02:09:27,511 --> 02:09:30,222
-+The living are not done with you, yet.
-+
-+1712
-+02:09:33,058 --> 02:09:35,519
-+<i>You can't beat him
-+hand-to-hand.</i>
-+
-+1713
-+02:09:36,645 --> 02:09:37,813
-+Analyse his fight pattern.
-+
-+1714
-+02:09:38,105 --> 02:09:39,273
-+<i>Scanning.</i>
-+
-+1715
-+02:09:43,986 --> 02:09:45,028
-+<i>Countermeasures ready.</i>
-+
-+1716
-+02:09:47,197 --> 02:09:48,115
-+Let's kick his ass.
-+
-+1717
-+02:10:01,879 --> 02:10:03,172
-+He's my friend.
-+
-+1718
-+02:10:03,922 --> 02:10:04,965
-+So was I.
-+
-+1719
-+02:10:12,014 --> 02:10:14,099
-+<i>Stay down. Final warning.</i>
-+
-+1720
-+02:10:28,572 --> 02:10:30,741
-+I could do this all day.
-+
-+1721
-+02:11:37,099 --> 02:11:39,351
-+That shield doesn't belong to you.
-+
-+1722
-+02:11:40,978 --> 02:11:42,646
-+You don't deserve it.
-+
-+1723
-+02:11:42,813 --> 02:11:44,856
-+My father made that shield!
-+
-+1724
-+02:12:20,517 --> 02:12:22,352
-+Meals at 8 and 5.
-+
-+1725
-+02:12:22,519 --> 02:12:24,146
-+Toilet privileges twice a day.
-+
-+1726
-+02:12:26,523 --> 02:12:28,692
-+Raise your voice, zap.
-+
-+1727
-+02:12:29,359 --> 02:12:31,361
-+Touch the glass, zap.
-+
-+1728
-+02:12:31,695 --> 02:12:33,697
-+You step out of line, you deal with me.
-+
-+1729
-+02:12:33,864 --> 02:12:36,033
-+Please, step out of line, hmm?
-+
-+1730
-+02:12:38,243 --> 02:12:39,661
-+So how does it feel?
-+
-+1731
-+02:12:40,579 --> 02:12:43,040
-+To spend all that time, all that effort...
-+
-+1732
-+02:12:45,917 --> 02:12:50,047
-+to see it fail so spectacularly?
-+
-+1733
-+02:12:54,051 --> 02:12:55,302
-+Did it?
-+
-+1734
-+02:13:20,786 --> 02:13:21,912
-+It's just the first pass.
-+
-+1735
-+02:13:22,037 --> 02:13:22,996
-+Yeah.
-+
-+1736
-+02:13:23,080 --> 02:13:25,123
-+Give me some feedback,
-+anything you think of.
-+
-+1737
-+02:13:25,290 --> 02:13:27,959
-+Shock absorption, lateral movement.
-+
-+1738
-+02:13:28,585 --> 02:13:29,586
-+Cup holder?
-+
-+1739
-+02:13:29,753 --> 02:13:31,338
-+You may wanna think about
-+some AC down in...
-+
-+1740
-+02:13:31,588 --> 02:13:32,631
-+Ow.
-+
-+1741
-+02:13:35,217 --> 02:13:36,426
-+Let's go. I'll give you a hand.
-+
-+1742
-+02:13:36,593 --> 02:13:38,261
-+No. Don't help me.
-+
-+1743
-+02:13:41,473 --> 02:13:42,474
-+Ah.
-+
-+1744
-+02:13:54,319 --> 02:13:55,612
-+138.
-+
-+1745
-+02:13:56,446 --> 02:13:59,074
-+138 combat missions.
-+
-+1746
-+02:13:59,241 --> 02:14:00,992
-+That's how many I've flown, Tony.
-+
-+1747
-+02:14:01,243 --> 02:14:04,287
-+Every one of them
-+could've been my last, but I flew them.
-+
-+1748
-+02:14:06,164 --> 02:14:07,708
-+Because the fight needed to be fought.
-+
-+1749
-+02:14:08,208 --> 02:14:09,835
-+It's the same with these Accords.
-+
-+1750
-+02:14:10,502 --> 02:14:14,005
-+I signed because it was
-+the right thing to do.
-+
-+1751
-+02:14:15,966 --> 02:14:18,009
-+And yeah, this sucks. This is, uh...
-+
-+1752
-+02:14:19,302 --> 02:14:21,138
-+This is a bad beat.
-+
-+1753
-+02:14:23,181 --> 02:14:24,808
-+But it hasn't changed my mind.
-+
-+1754
-+02:14:26,476 --> 02:14:27,853
-+I don't think.
-+
-+1755
-+02:14:38,280 --> 02:14:39,656
-+- You okay?
-+- Oh, yeah.
-+
-+1756
-+02:14:42,993 --> 02:14:45,996
-+Are you Tony Stank?
-+
-+1757
-+02:14:46,204 --> 02:14:50,459
-+Yes, this is Tony Stank.
-+You're in the right place.
-+
-+1758
-+02:14:50,625 --> 02:14:52,335
-+Thank you for that!
-+
-+1759
-+02:14:52,502 --> 02:14:54,337
-+Never dropping that, by the way.
-+
-+1760
-+02:14:54,504 --> 02:14:56,423
-+"Table for one, Mr Stank.
-+
-+1761
-+02:14:56,506 --> 02:14:57,674
-+"Please, by the bathroom."
-+
-+1762
-+02:15:04,222 --> 02:15:05,182
-+<i>Tony...</i>
-+
-+1763
-+02:15:06,391 --> 02:15:08,351
-+<i>I'm glad you're back at the compound.</i>
-+
-+1764
-+02:15:08,518 --> 02:15:11,563
-+<i>I don't like the idea of you
-+rattling around a mansion by yourself.</i>
-+
-+1765
-+02:15:11,730 --> 02:15:13,106
-+<i>We all need family.</i>
-+
-+1766
-+02:15:14,524 --> 02:15:18,361
-+<i>The Avengers are yours.
-+Maybe more so than mine.</i>
-+
-+1767
-+02:15:19,154 --> 02:15:21,698
-+<i>I've been on my own since I was 18.</i>
-+
-+1768
-+02:15:22,491 --> 02:15:25,160
-+<i>I never really fit in anywhere,</i>
-+
-+1769
-+02:15:25,243 --> 02:15:27,078
-+<i>even in the Army.</i>
-+
-+1770
-+02:15:28,705 --> 02:15:31,875
-+<i>My faith's in people, I guess.</i>
-+
-+1771
-+02:15:32,042 --> 02:15:33,251
-+<i>Individuals.</i>
-+
-+1772
-+02:15:34,211 --> 02:15:37,255
-+<i>And I'm happy to say that,
-+for the most part...</i>
-+
-+1773
-+02:15:37,422 --> 02:15:39,049
-+<i>they haven't let me down.</i>
-+
-+1774
-+02:15:41,051 --> 02:15:43,553
-+<i>Which is why I can't
-+let them down either.</i>
-+
-+1775
-+02:15:47,516 --> 02:15:50,894
-+<i>Locks can be replaced,
-+but maybe they shouldn't.</i>
-+
-+1776
-+02:15:52,771 --> 02:15:54,898
-+<i>I know I hurt you, Tony.</i>
-+
-+1777
-+02:15:55,065 --> 02:15:58,151
-+<i>I guess I thought by not telling you
-+about your parents...</i>
-+
-+1778
-+02:15:58,235 --> 02:16:00,570
-+<i>I was sparing you...</i>
-+
-+1779
-+02:16:00,737 --> 02:16:03,406
-+<i>but I can see now that
-+I was really sparing myself.</i>
-+
-+1780
-+02:16:03,907 --> 02:16:05,909
-+<i>And I'm sorry.</i>
-+
-+1781
-+02:16:06,076 --> 02:16:08,245
-+<i>Hopefully one day you can understand.</i>
-+
-+1782
-+02:16:09,120 --> 02:16:10,872
-+<i>I wish we agreed on the Accords.</i>
-+
-+1783
-+02:16:10,956 --> 02:16:12,541
-+<i>I really do.</i>
-+
-+1784
-+02:16:12,707 --> 02:16:14,209
-+<i>I know you're doing what you believe in,</i>
-+
-+1785
-+02:16:14,292 --> 02:16:15,836
-+<i>and that's all any of us can do.</i>
-+
-+1786
-+02:16:15,919 --> 02:16:17,295
-+<i>That's all any of us should.</i>
-+
-+1787
-+02:16:17,379 --> 02:16:19,381
-+<i>Priority call
-+from Secretary Ross.</i>
-+
-+1788
-+02:16:19,464 --> 02:16:21,758
-+<i>There's been a breach
-+at the Raft prison.</i>
-+
-+1789
-+02:16:23,051 --> 02:16:24,803
-+Yeah, put him through.
-+
-+1790
-+02:16:25,929 --> 02:16:27,389
-+<i>Tony, we have a problem.</i>
-+
-+1791
-+02:16:27,472 --> 02:16:29,474
-+- Uh, please hold.
-+<i>- No, don't.</i>
-+
-+1792
-+02:16:32,227 --> 02:16:33,603
-+<i>So no matter what...</i>
-+
-+1793
-+02:16:34,771 --> 02:16:36,106
-+<i>I promise you...</i>
-+
-+1794
-+02:16:36,231 --> 02:16:37,899
-+<i>if you need us...</i>
-+
-+1795
-+02:16:38,775 --> 02:16:40,735
-+<i>if you need me...</i>
-+
-+1796
-+02:16:44,990 --> 02:16:46,283
-+<i>I'll be there.</i>
-+
-+1797
-+02:18:45,610 --> 02:18:46,653
-+You sure about this?
-+
-+1798
-+02:18:48,863 --> 02:18:50,740
-+I can't trust my own mind.
-+
-+1799
-+02:18:53,535 --> 02:18:56,121
-+So, until they figure out
-+how to get this stuff out of my head...
-+
-+1800
-+02:18:56,287 --> 02:18:58,748
-+I think going back under
-+is the best thing.
-+
-+1801
-+02:18:59,457 --> 02:19:00,959
-+For everybody.
-+
-+1802
-+02:19:23,231 --> 02:19:24,607
-+Thank you for this.
-+
-+1803
-+02:19:27,110 --> 02:19:29,154
-+Your friend and my father...
-+
-+1804
-+02:19:30,113 --> 02:19:31,948
-+they were both victims.
-+
-+1805
-+02:19:33,450 --> 02:19:36,786
-+If I can help one of them find peace...
-+
-+1806
-+02:19:39,622 --> 02:19:42,333
-+You know, if they find out he's here...
-+
-+1807
-+02:19:42,500 --> 02:19:44,544
-+they'll come for him.
-+
-+1808
-+02:19:46,463 --> 02:19:48,131
-+Let them try.
-+
-+1809
-+02:23:39,028 --> 02:23:43,449

-+02:26:30,658 --> 02:26:32,034
-+Who was it? Who hit you?
-+
-+1851
-+02:26:32,201 --> 02:26:33,369
-+Some guy.
-+
-+1852
-+02:26:33,536 --> 02:26:35,163
-+So itchy, man, God.
-+
-+1853
-+02:26:35,329 --> 02:26:36,539
-+What's "some guy's" name?
-+
-+1854
-+02:26:36,706 --> 02:26:38,207
-+Uh, Steve.
-+
-+1855
-+02:26:38,374 --> 02:26:40,376
-+Steve? From 12-C?
-+
-+1856
-+02:26:40,543 --> 02:26:42,420
-+- With the overbite?
-+- No, no, no.
-+
-+1857
-+02:26:42,712 --> 02:26:44,338
-+You don't know him. He's from Brooklyn.
-+
-+1858
-+02:26:47,258 --> 02:26:48,259
-+Ouch.
-+
-+1859
-+02:26:48,384 --> 02:26:49,385
-+Well...
-+
-+1860
-+02:26:50,178 --> 02:26:51,929
-+I hope you got a few good licks in.
-+
-+1861
-+02:26:52,180 --> 02:26:54,432
-+Yeah, I got quite a few in, actually.
-+
-+1862
-+02:26:55,183 --> 02:26:58,227
-+His friend was huge. Like huge.
-+
-+1863
-+02:27:00,730 --> 02:27:03,065
-+That's way better. Thank you.
-+
-+1864
-+02:27:03,232 --> 02:27:05,234
-+Okay, tough guy.
-+
-+1865
-+02:27:07,904 --> 02:27:10,031
-+Love you, May.
-+Hey, can you shut the door?

VASILY KARPOV Well done, Soldier  \"\r\r\n2,STEVE ROGERS,\"All right, what do you see?  \"\r\r\n3,WANDA MAXIMOFF,Standard beat cops. Small station. Quiet street.

You see that Range Rover halfway up the block?  \"\r\r\n9,WANDA MAXIMOFF,\"Yeah, the red one? It’s cute.  \"\r\r\n10,NATASHA ROMANOFF,\"It's also bulletproof, which means private security, which means more guns, which means more headaches for somebody. Probably us.  \"\r\r\n11,WANDA MAXIMOFF,\"You guys know I can move things with my mind, right?  \"\r\r\n12,NATASHA ROMANOFF,Looking over your shoulder needs to become second nature.  \r\r\n13,SAM WILSON,Anybody ever tell you you're a little paranoid?  \r\r\n14,NATASHA ROMANOFF,Not to my face. Why? Did you hear something?  \r\r\n15,STEVE ROGERS,\"Eyes on target, folks. This is the best lead we've had on Rumlow in six months.

I’m empty.  \r\r\n47,NATASHA ROMANOFF,Out of the way!  MERCENARY #1 Drop it. Or I’ll drop this. Drop it!  MERCENARY #2 He'll do it!  \r\r\n48,NATASHA ROMANOFF,\"Payload secure. Thanks, Sam.  \"\r\r\n49,SAM WILSON,Don't thank me.  \r\r\n50,NATASHA ROMANOFF,I’m… not thanking that thing.  \r\r\n51,SAM WILSON,His name is Redwing.  \r\r\n52,NATASHA ROMANOFF,I'm still not thanking it.  \r\r\n53,SAM WILSON,\"He's cute. Go ahead, pet him.  \"\r\r\n54,BROCK RUMLOW,Come on!  \r\r\n55,BROCK RUMLOW,This is for dropping a building on my face.  \r\r\n56,BROCK RUMLOW,\"I think I look pretty good, all things considered.  \"\r\r\n57,STEVE ROGERS,Who's your buyer?  \r\r\n58,BROCK RUMLOW,\"You know, he knew you. You pal, your buddy, your Bucky.  \"\r\r\n59,STEVE ROGERS,What did you say?  \r\r\n60,BROCK RUMLOW,\"He remembered you. I was there. He got all weepy about it. Till they put his brain back in a blender. He wanted you to know something. He said to me, \"\"Please tell Rogers. When you gotta go, you gotta go.\"\" And you're coming with me.  \"\r\r\n61,STEVE ROGERS,Oh my . . .  Sam . . . We need . . . Fire and Rescue . . . on the south side of the building. We gotta get up there.  \r\r\n62,MARIA STARK,\"Try to remember the kind of September. When grass was green . . .  Wake up, dear, and say goodbye to your father.  \"\r\r\n63,HOWARD STARK,Who's the homeless person on the couch?  \r\r\n64,YOUNG TONY STARK,This is why I love coming home for Christmas . . . right before you leave town.  \r\r\n65,MARIA STARK,\"Be nice, dear, he's been studying abroad.  \"\r\r\n66,HOWARD STARK,\"Really, which broad? What's her name?  \"\r\r\n67,YOUNG TONY STARK,Candice.  \r\r\n68,HOWARD STARK,Do me a favor? Try not to burn the house down before Monday.  \r\r\n69,YOUNG TONY STARK,\"Okay, so it's Monday. That is good to know. I will plan my toga party accordingly. Where you going?  \"\r\r\n70,MARIA STARK,You father's flying us to the Bahamas for a little getaway.  \r\r\n71,HOWARD STARK,We might have to make a quick stop.  \r\r\n72,YOUNG TONY STARK,\"At the Pentagon. Right? Don't worry, you're gonna love the holiday menu at the commissary.  \"\r\r\n73,HOWARD STARK,\"You know, they say sarcasm is a metric for potential. If that's true, you'll be a great man some day. I'll get the bags.  \"\r\r\n74,MARIA STARK,\"He does miss you when you are not here. And frankly, you're going to miss us. Because this is the last time we're all going to be together. You know what's about to happen. Say something. If you don't, you'll regret it.  \"\r\r\n75,YOUNG TONY STARK,\"I love you, Dad. And I know you did the best you could.  \"\r\r\n76,TONY STARK,\"That's how I wished it happened. Binarily Augmented Retro-Framing, or BARF. God, I gotta work on that acronym. An extremely costly method of hijacking the hippocampus to . . . clear traumatic memories. Huh.  \"\r\r\n77,TONY STARK,\"It doesn't change the fact that they never made it to the airport . . . or all the things I did to avoid processing my grief, but . . .  Plus, 611 million dollars for my little therapeutic experiment? No one in the right mind would've ever funded it.  \"\r\r\n78,TONY STARK,\"Help me out, what's the MIT mission statement? \"\"To generate, disseminate . . . and preserve knowledge. And work with others . . . to bring it to bear on the world's great challenges.\"\" Well, you are the others. And, quiet as it's kept . . . the challenges facing you are the greatest mankind's ever known. Plus, most of you are broke.  \"\r\r\n79,TONY STARK,\"Oh, I'm sorry. Rather, you were. As of this moment . . . every student has been made an equal recipient of the Inaugural September Foundation Grant. As in . . . all of your projects have just been approved and funded.  \"\r\r\n80,TONY STARK,\"No strings, no taxes… just re-frame the future! Starting now.  \"\r\r\n81,TONY STARK,Go break some eggs.  \r\r\n82,MIT TEACHER,\"Wow. Wow. That uh . . . that took my breathe away. Oh, Tony! So generous. So much money! Wow! Out of curiosity . . . will any portion of that grant be made available to faculty? I know, \"\"Ooh, gross,\"\" but hear me out. I have got this killer idea for a self-cooking hot dog. Basically, chemical detonator embedded . . .  \"\r\r\n83,TONY STARK,\"Restroom's this way, yeah?  \"\r\r\n84,MIT TEACHER,Yeah. Embedded in the meat shaft.  \r\r\n85,STARK'S ASSISTANT,\"Mr. Stark, I am so sorry about the teleprompter. I didn't know Miss Potts had cancelled. They didn't have time to fix it.  \"\r\r\n86,TONY STARK,It's . . . fine. I'll be right back.  \r\r\n87,MIT TEACHER,\"We'll catch up later.  MRS. SPENCER That was nice, what you did for those young people.  \"\r\r\n88,TONY STARK,\"Ah, they deserve it. Plus, it helps ease my conscience.  MRS. SPENCER They say there's a correlation between generosity and guilt. But if you've got the money . . . break as many eggs as you like. Right?  \"\r\r\n89,TONY STARK,Are you going up?  MRS. SPENCER I'm right where I want to be.  \r\r\n90,TONY STARK,\"Okay, okay. Hey! Sorry, it's an occupational hazard.  MRS. SPENCER I work for the State Department. Human Resources. I know it's boring . . . but it enabled me to raise a son. I'm very proud of what he grew up to be.  \"\r\r\n91,MRS SPENCER,His name was Charlie Spencer. You murdered him. In Sokovia. Not that it matters in the least to you. You think you fight for us. You just fight for yourself.  \r\r\n92,MRS SPENCER,\"Who's going to avenge my son, Stark? He's dead . . . and I blame you.  NEWS ANCHOR #1 11 Wakandans were among those killed during a confrontation between the Avengers and a group of mercenaries in Lagos, Nigeria, last month. The traditionally reclusive Wakandans were on an outreach mission in Lagos when the attack occurred.  \"\r\r\n93,KING T'CHAKA,\"Our people's blood is spilled on foreign soil. Not only because of the actions of criminals, but by the indifference of those pledged to stop them. Victory at the expense of the innocent, is no victory at all.

Because that's the reality, if we don't respond to acts like these.  \"\r\r\n94,WANDA MAXIMOFF,It's my fault.  \r\r\n95,STEVE ROGERS,That's not true.  \r\r\n96,WANDA MAXIMOFF,Turn the TV back on. They're being very specific.  \r\r\n97,STEVE ROGERS,I should've clocked that bomb vest long before you had to deal with it.  \r\r\n98,STEVE ROGERS,\"Rumlow said \"\"Bucky\"\" and . . . all of a sudden I was a 16-year-old kid again, in Brooklyn.  \"\r\r\n99,STEVE ROGERS,And people died. It's on me.  \r\r\n100,WANDA MAXIMOFF,It's on both of us.  \r\r\n101,STEVE ROGERS,\"This job . . . we try to save as many people as we can. Sometimes that doesn't mean everybody. But if we can't find a way to live with that, next time . . . maybe nobody gets saved.  \"\r\r\n102,WANDA MAXIMOFF,Vis! We talked about this.  \r\r\n103,VISION,\"Yes, but the door was open so I assumed that . . .  \"\r\r\n104,VISION,Captain Rogers wished to know when Mr. Stark was arriving.  \r\r\n105,STEVE ROGERS,Thank you. We'll be right down.  \r\r\n106,VISION,\"I'll . . . use the door. Oh, and apparently, he's brought a guest.  \"\r\r\n107,STEVE ROGERS,We know who it is?  \r\r\n108,VISION,The Secretary of State.  \r\r\n109,SECRETARY ROSS,\"Five years ago, I had a heart attack. I dropped right in the middle of my back-swing. Turned out it was the best round of my life, because after 13 hours of surgery and a triple bypass . . . I found something 40 years in the Army had never taught me Perspective. The world owes the Avengers an un-payable debt. You have fought for us, protected us, risked your lives . . . but while a great many people see you as heroes, there are some . . . who would prefer the word \"\"vigilantes\"\".  \"\r\r\n110,NATASHA ROMANOFF,\"And what word would you use, Mr. Secretary?  \"\r\r\n111,SECRETARY ROSS,\"How about \"\"dangerous\"\"? What would you call a group of US-based, enhanced individuals who routinely ignore sovereign borders and inflict their will wherever they choose and who, frankly, seem unconcerned about what they leave behind?  \"\r\r\n112,SECRETARY ROSS,New York.  \r\r\n113,SECRETARY ROSS,Washington DC.  \r\r\n114,SECRETARY ROSS,Sokovia.  \r\r\n115,SECRETARY ROSS,Lagos.  \r\r\n116,STEVE ROGERS,Okay. That's enough.  \r\r\n117,SECRETARY ROSS,\"For the past four years, you've operated with unlimited power and no supervision. That's an arrangement the governments of the world can no longer tolerate. But I think we have a solution.  \"\r\r\n118,SECRETARY ROSS,\"The Sokovia Accords. Approved by 117 countries . . . it states that the Avengers shall no longer be a private organization. Instead, they'll operate under the supervision of a United Nations panel, only when and if that panel deems it necessary.  \"\r\r\n119,STEVE ROGERS,The Avengers were formed to make the world a safer place. I feel we've done that.  \r\r\n120,SECRETARY ROSS,\"Tell me, Captain, do you know where Thor and Banner are right now?  \"\r\r\n121,SECRETARY ROSS,\"If I misplaced a couple of 30 megaton nukes . . . you can bet there'd be consequences. Compromise. Reassurance. That's how the world works. Believe me, this is the middle ground.  \"\r\r\n122,JAMES RHODES,\"So, there are contingencies.  \"\r\r\n123,SECRETARY ROSS,\"Three days from now, the UN meets in Vienna to ratify the Accords.  \"\r\r\n124,SECRETARY ROSS,Talk it over.  \r\r\n125,NATASHA ROMANOFF,And if we come to a decision you don't like?  \r\r\n126,SECRETARY ROSS,Then you retire.  \r\r\n127,HELMUT ZEMO,Hello? Is this your car out front?  \r\r\n128,HELMUT ZEMO,I jumped the curb.  \r\r\n129,HELMUT ZEMO,\"Maybe we could take care of it ourselves. If you wanna call the cops, tha--that's okay too, I guess.  VASILY KARPOV No. No cops.  \"\r\r\n130,HELMUT ZEMO,Thank you.  \r\r\n131,HELMUT ZEMO,\"You have kept your looks, Colonel. Congratulations.  \"\r\r\n132,HELMUT ZEMO,\"\"\"Mission report December 16, 1991.\"\"  VASILY KARPOV Who are you?  \"\r\r\n133,HELMUT ZEMO,\"My name is Zemo. I will repeat my question. Mission report. December 16, 1991.  VASILY KARPOV How did you find me?  \"\r\r\n134,HELMUT ZEMO,\"When SHIELD fell, Black Widow released HYDRA files to the public. Millions of pages much of it encrypted, not easy to decipher. But . . . I have experience. And patience. A man can do anything if he has those.  VASILY KARPOV What do you want?  \"\r\r\n135,HELMUT ZEMO,Mission report. December 16. 1991.  VASILY KARPOV Go . . . to . . . hell.  \r\r\n136,HELMUT ZEMO,HYDRA deserves its place on the ash heap. So your death would not bother me. But I'd have to use this book . . . and other bloodier methods to find what I need. I don't look forward to that. You'd only be dying for . . . your pride.  VASILY KARPOV Hail HYDRA.  \r\r\n137,JAMES RHODES,\"Secretary Ross has a Congressional Medal of Honor, which is one more than you have.  \"\r\r\n138,SAM WILSON,So let's say we agree to this thing. How long is it gonna be before they LoJack us like a bunch of common criminals?  \r\r\n139,JAMES RHODES,\"A 117 countries want to sign this. 117, Sam, and you're just like, \"\"No, that's cool. We got it. \"\"  \"\r\r\n140,SAM WILSON,How long are you going to play both sides?  \r\r\n141,VISION,I have an equation.  \r\r\n142,SAM WILSON,\"Oh, this will clear it up.  \"\r\r\n143,VISION,\"In the eight years since Mr. Stark announced himself as Iron Man, the number of known enhanced persons has grown exponentially. And during the same period, the number of potentially world-ending events has risen at a commensurate rate.  \"\r\r\n144,STEVE ROGERS,Are you saying it's our fault?  \r\r\n145,VISION,I'm saying there may be a causality. Our very strength invites challenge. Challenge incites conflict. And conflict . . . breeds catastrophe. Oversight . . . oversight is not an idea that can be dismissed out of hand.  \r\r\n146,JAMES RHODES,Boom.  \r\r\n147,NATASHA ROMANOFF,Tony. You are being uncharacteristically non-hyper-verbal.  \r\r\n148,STEVE ROGERS,It's because he's already made up his mind.  \r\r\n149,TONY STARK,\"Boy, you know me so well.  \"\r\r\n150,TONY STARK,\"Actually, I'm nursing an electromagnetic headache.  \"\r\r\n151,TONY STARK,\"That's what's going on, Cap. It's just pain. It's discomfort. Who's putting coffee grounds in the disposal? Am I running a bed and breakfast for a biker gang?  \"\r\r\n152,TONY STARK,\"Oh, that's Charles Spencer, by the way. He's a great kid. Computer engineering degree, 3.6 GPA. Had a floor level gig at Intel planned for the fall. But first, he wanted to put a few miles on his soul, before he parked it behind a desk. See the world. Maybe be of service. Charlie didn't want to go to Vegas or Fort Lauderdale, which is what I would do. He didn't go to Paris or Amsterdam, which sounds fun. He decided to spend his summer building sustainable housing for the poor. Guess where, Sokovia.  \"\r\r\n153,TONY STARK,\"He wanted to make a difference, I suppose. I mean, we won't know because we dropped a building on him while we were kicking ass.  \"\r\r\n154,TONY STARK,\"There's no decision-making process here. We need to be put in check! Whatever form that takes, I'm game. If we can't accept limitations, if we're boundary-less, we're no better than the bad guys.  \"\r\r\n155,STEVE ROGERS,\"Tony, someone dies on your watch, you don't give up.  \"\r\r\n156,TONY STARK,Who said we're giving up?  \r\r\n157,STEVE ROGERS,We are if we're not taking responsibility for our actions. This document just shifts the blames.  \r\r\n158,JAMES RHODES,\"I'm sorry. Steve. That - that is dangerously arrogant. This is the United Nations we're talking about. It's not the World Security Council, it's not SHIELD, it's not HYDRA.  \"\r\r\n159,STEVE ROGERS,\"No, but it's run by people with agendas, and agendas change.  \"\r\r\n160,TONY STARK,\"That's good. That's why I'm here. When I realized what my weapons were capable of in the wrong hands, I shut it down and stop manufacturing.  \"\r\r\n161,STEVE ROGERS,\"Tony, you chose to do that. If we sign this, we surrender our right to choose. What if this panel sends us somewhere we don't think we should go? What if there is somewhere we need to go, and they don't let us? We may not be perfect, but the safest hands are still our own.  \"\r\r\n162,TONY STARK,\"If we don't do this now, it's gonna be done to us later. That's the fact. That won't be pretty.  \"\r\r\n163,WANDA MAXIMOFF,You're saying they'll come for me.  \r\r\n164,VISION,We would protect you.  \r\r\n165,NATASHA ROMANOFF,Maybe Tony's right.  \r\r\n166,NATASHA ROMANOFF,\"If we have one hand on the wheel, we can still steer. If we take it off -  \"\r\r\n167,SAM WILSON,Aren't you the same woman who told the government to kiss her ass a few years ago?  \r\r\n168,NATASHA ROMANOFF,I'm just . . . I'm reading the terrain. We have made . . . some very public mistakes. We need to win their trust back.  \r\r\n169,TONY STARK,\"Focus up. I'm sorry, did I just mishear you or did you agree with me?  \"\r\r\n170,NATASHA ROMANOFF,\"Oh, I want to take it back now.  \"\r\r\n171,TONY STARK,\"No, no, no. You can't retract it. Thank you. Unprecedented. Okay, case closed--I win.  \"\r\r\n172,STEVE ROGERS,I have to go.  \r\r\n173,PRIEST,\"And now, I would like to invite Sharon Carter to come up and say a few words.  \"\r\r\n174,SHARON CARTER,Margaret Carter was known to most as a founder of SHIELD . . . but I just knew her as Aunt Peggy.  \r\r\n175,SHARON CARTER,\"She had a photograph in her office. Aunt Peggy standing next to JFK. As a kid, that was pretty cool. But it was a lot to live up to. Which is why I never told anyone we were related.  \"\r\r\n176,SHARON CARTER,\"I asked her once how she managed to master diplomacy and espionage in a time when no one wanted to see a woman succeed at either. And she said, compromise where you can. But where you can't, don't. Even if everyone is telling you that something wrong is something right. Even if the whole world is telling you to move . . . it is your duty to plant yourself like a tree, look them in they eye and say \"\" No, you move.\"\"  \"\r\r\n177,STEVE ROGERS,\"When I came out of the ice, I thought everyone I had known was gone. Then I found out that she was alive. I was just lucky to have her.  \"\r\r\n178,NATASHA ROMANOFF,\"She had you back, too.  \"\r\r\n179,STEVE ROGERS,Who else signed?  \r\r\n180,NATASHA ROMANOFF,Tony. Rhodey. Vision.  \r\r\n181,STEVE ROGERS,Clint?  \r\r\n182,NATASHA ROMANOFF,Says he's retired.  \r\r\n183,STEVE ROGERS,Wanda?  \r\r\n184,NATASHA ROMANOFF,\r\r\n185,NATASHA ROMANOFF,Just because it's the path of least resistance doesn't mean it's the wrong path. Staying together is more important than how we stay together.  \r\r\n186,STEVE ROGERS,What are we giving up to do it?  \r\r\n187,STEVE ROGERS,\"I'm sorry, Nat. I can't sign it.  \"\r\r\n188,NATASHA ROMANOFF,I know.  \r\r\n189,STEVE ROGERS,Then what are you doing here?  \r\r\n190,NATASHA ROMANOFF,I didn't want you to be alone.  \r\r\n191,NATASHA ROMANOFF,Come here.

Those men and women killed in Nigeria, were part of a goodwill mission from a country too long in the shadows. We will not, however, let misfortune drive us back. We will fight to improve the world we wish to join. I am grateful to the Avengers for supporting this initiative.  Wakanda is proud to extend its hand in peace.  \"\r\r\n217,T'CHALLA,EVERYBODY GET DOWN!  \r\r\n218,SHARON CARTER,\"My mom tried to talk me out of enlisting, but, um, not Aunt Peggy.

The people that shoot at you usually wind up shooting at me.  \"\r\r\n253,SHARON CARTER,\"Tips have been pouring in since that footage went public. Everybody thinks the Winter soldier goes to their gym. Most of it's noise. Except for this.  My boss expects a briefing, pretty much now . . . so that's all the head start you're gonna get.  \"\r\r\n254,STEVE ROGERS,Thank you.  \r\r\n255,SHARON CARTER,And you're gonna have to hurry. We have orders to shoot on sight.  \r\r\n256,HELMUT ZEMO,Homecoming. One. One. Fright Car.  \r\r\n257,GERMAN INNKEEPER,Mr. Muller. I have your breakfast.  \r\r\n258,HELMUT ZEMO,I could smell it before I opened the door. Thank you.  \r\r\n259,GERMAN INNKEEPER,\r\r\n260,HELMUT ZEMO,It's okay. This is wonderful.  \r\r\n261,GERMAN INNKEEPER,I'll put this on your . . .  \r\r\n262,HELMUT ZEMO,\"No, no. It's okay. I can manage. Thank you Mrs. Leiber.  \"\r\r\n263,BUCKY BARNES,\"How are they? Are they good? Give me six, thank you.  \"\r\r\n264,SAM WILSON,\"Heads up, Cap. German Special Forces, approaching from the south.  \"\r\r\n265,STEVE ROGERS,Understood.  Do you know me?  \r\r\n266,BUCKY BARNES,You're Steve. I read about you in a museum.  \r\r\n267,SAM WILSON,They've set the perimeter.  \r\r\n268,STEVE ROGERS,I know you're nervous. And you have plenty of reason to be. But you're lying.  \r\r\n269,BUCKY BARNES,I wasn't in Vienna. I don't do that anymore.  \r\r\n270,SAM WILSON,They're entering the building.  \r\r\n271,STEVE ROGERS,\"Well, the people who think you did are coming here now. And they're not planning on taking you alive.  \"\r\r\n272,BUCKY BARNES,That's smart. Good strategy.  \r\r\n273,SAM WILSON,They're on the roof. I'm compromised.  \r\r\n274,STEVE ROGERS,\"This doesn't have end in a fight, Buck.  \"\r\r\n275,BUCKY BARNES,It always ends in a fight.  \r\r\n276,SAM WILSON,5 seconds.  \r\r\n277,STEVE ROGERS,You pulled me from the river. Why?  \r\r\n278,BUCKY BARNES,I don't know.  \r\r\n279,SAM WILSON,3 seconds!  \r\r\n280,STEVE ROGERS,\"Yes, you do.  \"\r\r\n281,SAM WILSON,Breach! Breach! Breach!  GSG-9 SOLDIER \r\r\n282,STEVE ROGERS,\"Buck, stop! You're gonna kill someone.  \"\r\r\n283,BUCKY BARNES,I'm not gonna kill anyone.  GSG-9 SOLDIER Suspect has broken containment! He's headed down the east stairwell!  \r\r\n284,STEVE ROGERS,\"Come on, man.  \"\r\r\n285,STEVE ROGERS,\"Sam, southwest rooftop.  \"\r\r\n286,SAM WILSON,Who the hell's the other guy?  \r\r\n287,STEVE ROGERS,About to find out.  \r\r\n288,STEVE ROGERS,Sam.  \r\r\n289,SAM WILSON,Got him.  GSG-9 DRIVER Stand down! Stand down!  \r\r\n290,STEVE ROGERS,\"Sam, I can't shake this guy.  \"\r\r\n291,SAM WILSON,Right behind you.  \r\r\n292,JAMES RHODES,\"Stand down, now.  Congratulations, Cap.

A pinch.  \r\r\n295,WANDA MAXIMOFF,Is that paprikash?  \r\r\n296,VISION,I thought it might . . . lift your spirits.  \r\r\n297,WANDA MAXIMOFF,Spirits lifted.  \r\r\n298,VISION,\"In my defense, I haven't actually ever . . . eaten anything before, so . . .  \"\r\r\n299,WANDA MAXIMOFF,May I?  \r\r\n300,VISION,Please. Wanda?  \r\r\n301,WANDA MAXIMOFF,Hmm.  \r\r\n302,VISION,\"No one dislikes you, Wanda.  \"\r\r\n303,WANDA MAXIMOFF,Thanks.  \r\r\n304,VISION,\"Oh, you're welcome. No, it's a . . . involuntary response in their amygdala. They can't help but be afraid of you.  \"\r\r\n305,WANDA MAXIMOFF,Are you?  \r\r\n306,VISION,\"My amygdala is synthetic, so . . .  \"\r\r\n307,WANDA MAXIMOFF,\"I used to think of myself one way. But after this . . .  I am something else. I'm still me, I think, but . . . that's not what everyone else sees.  \"\r\r\n308,VISION,\"Do you know, I don't know what this is?  Not really. I know it's not of this world, that it powered Loki's staff, gave you your abilities, but . . . its true nature is a mystery. And yet, it is part of me.  \"\r\r\n309,WANDA MAXIMOFF,Are you afraid of it?  \r\r\n310,VISION,\"I wish to understand it. The more I do, the less it controls me. One day . . . who knows? I may even control it.  \"\r\r\n311,WANDA MAXIMOFF,I don't know what's in this but it is not paprika. I'm gonna go to the store. I'll be back in 20 minutes.  \r\r\n312,VISION,\"Alternatively, we could order a pizza?  \"\r\r\n313,WANDA MAXIMOFF,\"Vision, are you not letting me leave?  \"\r\r\n314,VISION,It is a question of safety.  \r\r\n315,WANDA MAXIMOFF,I can protect myself.  \r\r\n316,VISION,Not yours. Mr. Stark would like to avoid the possibility of another public incident. Until the Accords are on a . . . more secured foundation.  \r\r\n317,WANDA MAXIMOFF,And what do you want?  \r\r\n318,VISION,For people to see you . . . as I do.  \r\r\n319,SAM WILSON,\"So, you like cats?  \"\r\r\n320,STEVE ROGERS,Sam.  \r\r\n321,SAM WILSON,What? Dude shows up dressed like a cat and you don't wanna know more?  \r\r\n322,STEVE ROGERS,Your suit . . . t's Vibranium?  \r\r\n323,T'CHALLA,\"The Black Panther has been the protector of Wakanda for generations. A mantle, passed from warrior to warrior. And now, because your friend murdered my father, I also wear the mantle of king. So, I ask you . . . as both warrior and king . . . how long do you think you can keep your friend safe from me?  \"\r\r\n324,STEVE ROGERS,What's gonna happen to him?  \r\r\n325,EVERETT ROSS,Same thing that ought to happen to you. Psychological evaluation and extradition.  \r\r\n326,SHARON CARTER,\"This is Everett Ross, Deputy Task Force Commander.  \"\r\r\n327,STEVE ROGERS,What about our lawyer?  \r\r\n328,EVERETT ROSS,\"Lawyer. That's funny. See their weapons are placed in lockup. Oh, we'll write you a receipt.  \"\r\r\n329,SAM WILSON,I better not look out the window and see anybody flying around in that.  \r\r\n330,EVERETT ROSS,\"You'll be provided with an office instead of a cell. Now, do me a favor, stay in it?  \"\r\r\n331,T'CHALLA,I don't intend on going anywhere.  \r\r\n332,NATASHA ROMANOFF,\"For the record, this is what making things worse looks like.  \"\r\r\n333,STEVE ROGERS,He's alive.  \r\r\n334,TONY STARK,\"No. Romania was not Accords-sanctioned. And, Colonel Rhodes is supervising cleanup.  \"\r\r\n335,NATASHA ROMANOFF,Try not to break anything while we fix this.  \r\r\n336,TONY STARK,\"Consequences? You bet there'll be consequences. Obviously you can quote me on that 'cause I just said it. Anything else? Thank you, sir.  \"\r\r\n337,STEVE ROGERS,'Consequences'?  \r\r\n338,TONY STARK,Secretary Ross wants you both prosecuted. Had to give him something.  \r\r\n339,STEVE ROGERS,\"I'm not getting that shield back, am I?  \"\r\r\n340,NATASHA ROMANOFF,\"Technically, it's the government's property. Wings, too.  \"\r\r\n341,SAM WILSON,That's cold.  \r\r\n342,TONY STARK,Warmer than jail.  \r\r\n343,DELIVERY TRUCK DRIVER,\r\r\n344,TONY STARK,\"Hey, you wanna see something cool? I pulled something from Dad's archives. Felt timely.  FDR signed the Lend-Lease bill with these in 1941. Provided support to the Allies when they needed it most.  \"\r\r\n345,STEVE ROGERS,Some would say it brought our country closer to war.  \r\r\n346,TONY STARK,\"See? If not for these, you wouldn't be here. I'm trying to . . . what do you call it? That's an olive branch. Is that what you call it?  \"\r\r\n347,STEVE ROGERS,Is Pepper here? I didn't see her.  \r\r\n348,TONY STARK,\"We're kinda . . . well, not kinda . . .  \"\r\r\n349,STEVE ROGERS,Pregnant?  \r\r\n350,TONY STARK,No. Definitely not. We're taking a break. It's nobody's fault.  \r\r\n351,STEVE ROGERS,\"I'm so sorry, Tony. I didn't know.  \"\r\r\n352,TONY STARK,\"A few years ago, I almost lost her, so I trashed all my suits. Then, we had to mop up HYDRA . . . and then Ultron. My fault. And then, and then, and then, I never stopped. Because the truth is I don't wanna stop. I don't wanna lose her. I thought maybe the Accords could split the difference.  In her defense, I'm a handful. Yet, Dad was a pain in the ass, but he and Mom always made it work.  \"\r\r\n353,STEVE ROGERS,\"You know, I'm glad Howard got married. I only knew him when he was young and single.  \"\r\r\n354,TONY STARK,\"Oh, really? You two knew each other? He never mentioned that. Maybe only a thousand times. God, I hated you.  \"\r\r\n355,STEVE ROGERS,I don't mean to make things difficult.  \r\r\n356,TONY STARK,\"I know, because you're a very polite person.  \"\r\r\n357,STEVE ROGERS,If I see a situation pointed south . . . I can't ignore it. Sometimes I wish I could.  \r\r\n358,TONY STARK,\"No, you don't.  \"\r\r\n359,STEVE ROGERS,\"No, I don't. Sometimes . . .  \"\r\r\n360,TONY STARK,\"Sometimes I wanna punch you in your perfect teeth. But I don't wanna see you gone. We need you, Cap. So far, nothing's happened that can't be undone, if you sign. We can make the last 24 hours legit. Barnes gets transferred to an American psych-center . . . instead of a Wakandan prison.  \"\r\r\n361,STEVE ROGERS,\"I'm not saying it's impossible, but there would have to be safeguards.  \"\r\r\n362,TONY STARK,\"Sure. Once we put out the PR fire, those documents can be amended. I'd file a motion to have you and Wanda reinstated . . .  \"\r\r\n363,STEVE ROGERS,Wanda? What about Wanda?  \r\r\n364,TONY STARK,\"She's fine. She's confined to the compound, currently. Vision's keeping her company.  \"\r\r\n365,STEVE ROGERS,\"Oh God, Tony! Every time. Every time I think you see things the right way . . .  \"\r\r\n366,TONY STARK,What? It's a 100 acres with a lap pool. It's got a screening room. There's worse ways to protect people.  \r\r\n367,STEVE ROGERS,\"Protection? Is that how you see this? This is protection? It's internment, Tony.  \"\r\r\n368,TONY STARK,She's not a US citizen.  \r\r\n369,STEVE ROGERS,\"Oh, come on, Tony.  \"\r\r\n370,TONY STARK,And they don't grant visas to weapons of mass destruction.  \r\r\n371,STEVE ROGERS,She's a kid!  \r\r\n372,TONY STARK,GIVE ME A BREAK! I'm doing what has to be done . . . to stave off something worse.  \r\r\n373,STEVE ROGERS,You keep telling yourself that.  Hate to break up the set.  \r\r\n374,HELMUT ZEMO,\"Hello, Mr. Barnes. I've been sent by the United Nations to evaluate you. Do you mind if I sit? Your first name is James?  \"\r\r\n375,SHARON CARTER,The receipt for your gear.  \r\r\n376,SAM WILSON,'Bird costume'? Come on.  \r\r\n377,SHARON CARTER,I didn't write it.  \r\r\n378,HELMUT ZEMO,\"I'm not here to judge you. I just want to ask you a few questions. Do you know where you are, James?

It's a good way to flush a guy out of hiding. Set off a bomb, get your picture taken. Get seven billion people looking for the Winter Soldier.  \"\r\r\n386,SHARON CARTER,You're saying someone framed him to find him.  \r\r\n387,SAM WILSON,\"Steve, we looked for the guy for two years and found nothing.  \"\r\r\n388,STEVE ROGERS,We didn't bomb the UN. That turns a lot of heads.  \r\r\n389,SHARON CARTER,\"Yeah, but that doesn't guarantee that whoever framed him would get him. It guarantees that we would.  \"\r\r\n390,STEVE ROGERS,Yeah.  \r\r\n391,HELMUT ZEMO,\"Tell me, Bucky. You've seen a great deal, haven't you?  \"\r\r\n392,BUCKY BARNES,I don't want to talk about it.  \r\r\n393,HELMUT ZEMO,\"You fear that… if you open your mouth, the horrors might never stop. Don't worry.  We only have to talk about one.  \"\r\r\n394,CUSTODIAN,\r\r\n395,DELIVERY TRUCK DRIVER,\r\r\n396,EVERETT ROSS,\"Great. Come on, guys, get me eyes on Barnes.

I was actually having a real good day today, you know, Mr. Stark. Didn't miss my train, this perfectly good DVD player was just sitting there and . . . Algebra test. Nailed it!  \"\r\r\n528,TONY STARK,Who else knows? Anybody?  \r\r\n529,PETER PARKER,Nobody.  \r\r\n530,TONY STARK,Not even your . . . unusually attractive aunt?  \r\r\n531,PETER PARKER,\"No. No, no.

Who manufactured that?  \r\r\n533,PETER PARKER,I did.  \r\r\n534,TONY STARK,\"Climbing the walls, how you doing that? Cohesive gloves.  \"\r\r\n535,PETER PARKER,It's a long story.

It's just that… when whatever happened, happened . . . it's like my senses have been dialed to 11.

But I can't tell anybody that, so I'm not. When you can do the things that I can, but you don't . . .  and then the bad things happen . . . they happen because of you.  \"\r\r\n544,TONY STARK,\"So you wanna look out for the little guy? You wanna do your part? Make the world a better place, all that, right?  \"\r\r\n545,PETER PARKER,Yeah. Yeah just looking out . . . for the little guy. That's--that's what it is.  \r\r\n546,TONY STARK,\"I'm gonna sit here, so you move the leg.  You got a passport?  \"\r\r\n547,PETER PARKER,\"Uh, no.

That was 24 hours ago. Can you help a brother out?  \"\r\r\n620,STEVE ROGERS,You're after the wrong guy.  \r\r\n621,TONY STARK,Your judgment is askew. Your old war buddy killed innocent people yesterday.  \r\r\n622,STEVE ROGERS,\"And there are five more super soldiers just like him. I can't let the doctor find them first, Tony.

I won't ask a second time.  \"\r\r\n647,SCOTT LANG,\"Look, I really don't want to hurt you.  \"\r\r\n648,NATASHA ROMANOFF,I wouldn't stress about it.  \r\r\n649,BUCKY BARNES,What the hell is that?  \r\r\n650,SAM WILSON,Everyone's got a gimmick now.  \r\r\n651,PETER PARKER,\"You have a metal arm?

This won't kill you but it ain't gonna tickle either.  \"\r\r\n653,TONY STARK,\"Wanda, I think you hurt Vision's feelings.  \"\r\r\n654,WANDA MAXIMOFF,You locked me in my room.  \r\r\n655,TONY STARK,\"Okay. First, that's an exaggeration. Second, I did it to protect you. Hey, Clint.  \"\r\r\n656,TONY STARK,\"Clearly, retirement doesn't suit you.

Hey buddy, I think you lost this!  Those wings carbon fiber?  \"\r\r\n661,SAM WILSON,Is this stuff coming out of you?  \r\r\n662,PETER PARKER,\"That would explain the rigidity-flexibility ratio, which, gotta say, that's awesome, man.  \"\r\r\n663,SAM WILSON,I don't know if you've been a fight before but there's usually not this much talking.  \r\r\n664,PETER PARKER,\"Alright, sorry, my bad.  Guys, look. I'd love to keep this up but I've only got one job here today and I gotta impress Mr. Stark, so, l'm really sorry.

There's a lot going on here that you don't understand.  \r\r\n687,PETER PARKER,Mr. Stark said you'd say that. Wow.  He also said to go for your legs.  \r\r\n688,SAM WILSON,\"Clint, can you get him off me?  \"\r\r\n689,SCOTT LANG,\"Yeah. No, I'm good. I'm good, Arrow Guy. Let's go.

I've been picturing a red head.  \"\r\r\n789,FRIDAY,You must be thinking of someone else.  \r\r\n790,TONY STARK,Must be.  \r\r\n791,FRIDAY,\"The fake doctor is actually Colonel Helmut Zemo, Sokovian Intelligence.  Zemo ran Echo Skorpion, a Sokovian covert kill squad.  \"\r\r\n792,TONY STARK,\"So, what happened to the real Broussard?  \"\r\r\n793,FRIDAY,He was found dead in a Berlin hotel room. Where police also found a wig and facial prosthesis approximating the appearance of one James Buchanan Barnes.  \r\r\n794,TONY STARK,Son of a bitch. Get this to Ross.  \r\r\n795,FRIDAY,\"Yes, Boss.  \"\r\r\n796,GUARD,\"This is the Raft Prison Control. You're clear for landing, Mr. Stark.  \"\r\r\n797,TONY STARK,\"So? You got the files? Let's reroute the satellites, start facial scanning for this Zemo guy.  \"\r\r\n798,SECRETARY ROSS,You seriously think I'm gonna listen to you after that fiasco in Leipzig? You're lucky you're not in one of these cells.  \r\r\n799,TONY STARK,\"Give me a break, Barton. I had no idea they'll put you here. Come on.  \"\r\r\n800,TONY STARK,\"Yeah, but not some super-max floating ocean pokey. You know, this place is for maniacs. This is a place for . . .  \"\r\r\n801,TONY STARK,Because you broke the law.  \r\r\n802,TONY STARK,I didn't make you.  \r\r\n803,TONY STARK,\"You read it, you broke it.  \"\r\r\n804,TONY STARK,\"Alright, you're all grown up, you got a wife and kids. I don't understand, why didn't you think about them before you chose the wrong side?  \"\r\r\n805,SCOTT LANG,\"Hank Pym always said, you never can trust a Stark.  \"\r\r\n806,TONY STARK,Who are you?  \r\r\n807,SCOTT LANG,\"Come on, man.  \"\r\r\n808,SAM WILSON,How's Rhodes?  \r\r\n809,TONY STARK,They're flying him to Columbia Medical tomorrow. So . . . fingers cross. What do you need? They feed you yet?  \r\r\n810,SAM WILSON,You're the good cop now?  \r\r\n811,TONY STARK,I'm just the guy who needs to know where Steve went.  \r\r\n812,SAM WILSON,\"Well, you better go get a bad cop, because you're gonna have to go Mark Fuhrman on my ass to get information out of me.  \"\r\r\n813,TONY STARK,\"Oh, I just knocked the 'A' out of their 'AV'. We got about 30 seconds before they realize it's not their equipment.  \"\r\r\n814,SECRETARY ROSS,What did you do? Get it back up!  \r\r\n815,TONY STARK,\"Just look. Because that is the fellow who was supposed to interrogate Barnes.  Clearly, I made a mistake. Sam, I was wrong.  \"\r\r\n816,SAM WILSON,That's a first.  \r\r\n817,TONY STARK,Cap is definitely off the reservation but he's about to need all the help he can get. We don't know each other very well. You don't have to…  \r\r\n818,SAM WILSON,\"Hey, it's alright.  Look, I'll tell you… but you have to go alone and as a friend.  \"\r\r\n819,TONY STARK,Easy.  \r\r\n820,SECRETARY ROSS,Stark? Did he give you anything on Rogers?  \r\r\n821,TONY STARK,\"Nope. Told me to go to hell. I'm going back to the compound instead, but you can call me anytime. I'll put you on hold, I like to watch the line blink.  \"\r\r\n822,STEVE ROGERS,You remember that time we had to ride back from Rockaway Beach in the back of that freezer truck?  \r\r\n823,BUCKY BARNES,Was that the time we used our train money to buy hot dogs?  \r\r\n824,STEVE ROGERS,You blew three bucks trying to win that stuffed bear for a redhead.  \r\r\n825,BUCKY BARNES,What was her name again?  \r\r\n826,STEVE ROGERS,Dolores. You called her Doll.  \r\r\n827,BUCKY BARNES,She's gotta be a hundred years old right now.  \r\r\n828,STEVE ROGERS,\"So are we, pal.  \"\r\r\n829,STEVE ROGERS,He can't have been here more than a few hours.  \r\r\n830,BUCKY BARNES,Long enough to wake them up.  \r\r\n831,STEVE ROGERS,You ready?  \r\r\n832,BUCKY BARNES,Yeah.  \r\r\n833,TONY STARK,You seem a little defensive.  \r\r\n834,STEVE ROGERS,It's been a long day.  \r\r\n835,TONY STARK,\"At ease, Soldier. I'm not currently after you.  \"\r\r\n836,STEVE ROGERS,Then why are you here?  \r\r\n837,TONY STARK,\"Could be your story's not so crazy. Maybe. Ross has no idea I'm here. I'd like to keep it that way. Otherwise, I gotta arrest myself.  \"\r\r\n838,STEVE ROGERS,\"Well, that sounds like a lot of paperwork.  It's good to see you, Tony.  \"\r\r\n839,TONY STARK,\"You too, Cap.  Hey, Manchurian Candidate, you're killing me. There's a truce here. You can drop . . .  \"\r\r\n840,TONY STARK,I got heat signatures.  \r\r\n841,STEVE ROGERS,How many?  \r\r\n842,TONY STARK,\"Uh, one.  \"\r\r\n843,HELMUT ZEMO,\"If it's any comfort, they died in their sleep.  Did you really think I wanted more of you?  \"\r\r\n844,BUCKY BARNES,What the hell?  \r\r\n845,HELMUT ZEMO,\"I'm grateful to them, though. They brought you here.  Please, Captain. The Soviets built this chamber to withstand the launch blast of UR-100 rockets.  \"\r\r\n846,TONY STARK,I'm betting I could beat that.  \r\r\n847,HELMUT ZEMO,\"Oh, I'm sure you could, Mr. Stark. Given time. But then you'd never know why you came.  \"\r\r\n848,STEVE ROGERS,You killed innocent people in Vienna just to bring us here?  \r\r\n849,HELMUT ZEMO,\"I thought about nothing else for over a year. I studied you. I followed you. But now that you're standing here, I just realized . . . there's a bit of green in the blue of your eyes. How nice to find a flaw.  \"\r\r\n850,STEVE ROGERS,You're Sokovian. Is that what this is about?  \r\r\n851,HELMUT ZEMO,Sokovia was a failed state long before you blew it to hell. No. I'm here because I made a promise.  \r\r\n852,STEVE ROGERS,You lost someone?  \r\r\n853,HELMUT ZEMO,I lost everyone. And so will you.  An empire toppled by its enemies can rise again. But one which crumples from within? That's dead . . . forever.  \r\r\n854,TONY STARK,I know that road. What is this?  \r\r\n855,HOWARD STARK,Help my wife. Please. Help.  \r\r\n856,HOWARD STARK,Sergeant Barnes?  \r\r\n857,MARIA STARK,Howard!  \r\r\n858,MARIA STARK,Howard!  \r\r\n859,STEVE ROGERS,Tony. Tony.  \r\r\n860,TONY STARK,Did you know?  \r\r\n861,STEVE ROGERS,I didn't know it was him.  \r\r\n862,TONY STARK,\"Don't bullshit me, Rogers! Did you know?  \"\r\r\n863,STEVE ROGERS,Yes.  \r\r\n864,STEVE ROGERS,Get out of here!  \r\r\n865,STEVE ROGERS,\"It wasn't him, Tony. Hydra had control of his mind!  \"\r\r\n866,TONY STARK,Move!  \r\r\n867,STEVE ROGERS,It wasn't him!  \r\r\n868,FRIDAY,Left boot jet failing. Flight systems compromised.  \r\r\n869,TONY STARK,Ah crap.  \r\r\n870,STEVE ROGERS,He's not going to stop. Go.  \r\r\n871,TONY STARK,\"Come on, come on.  \"\r\r\n872,FRIDAY,\"Targeting system's knackered, boss.  \"\r\r\n873,TONY STARK,I'm eyeballing it.  Do you even remember them?  \r\r\n874,BUCKY BARNES,I remember all of them.  \r\r\n875,STEVE ROGERS,This isn't gonna change what happened.  \r\r\n876,TONY STARK,I don't care. He killed my mom.  \r\r\n877,ZEMO'S WIFE,\"You should've seen his little face. Just try, okay? I'm going to bed. I love you.  \"\r\r\n878,T'CHALLA,I almost kill the wrong man.  \r\r\n879,HELMUT ZEMO,Hardly an innocent one.  \r\r\n880,T'CHALLA,This is all you wanted? To see them rip each other apart.  \r\r\n881,HELMUT ZEMO,\"My father lived outside the city. I thought we would be safe there. My son was excited. He could see the Iron Man from the car window. I told my wife, \"\"Don't worry. They are fighting in the city. We're miles from harm.\"\" When the dust cleared . . . and the screaming stopped. It took me two days until I found their bodies. My father . . . still holding my wife and son in his arms. And the Avengers? They went home. I knew I couldn't kill them. More powerful men than me have tried. But, if I could get them to kill each other . . . I'm sorry about your father. He seemed a good man. With a dutiful son.  \"\r\r\n882,T'CHALLA,Vengeance has consumed you. It's consuming them.  I am done letting it consume me. Justice will come soon enough.  \r\r\n883,HELMUT ZEMO,Tell that to the dead.  \r\r\n884,T'CHALLA,The living are not done with you yet.  \r\r\n885,FRIDAY,You can't beat him hand to hand.  \r\r\n886,TONY STARK,Analyse his fight pattern.  \r\r\n887,FRIDAY,Scanning!  Countermeasures ready.  \r\r\n888,TONY STARK,Let's kick his ass.  \r\r\n889,STEVE ROGERS,He's my friend.  \r\r\n890,TONY STARK,So was I.  Stay down. Final warning.  \r\r\n891,STEVE ROGERS,I can do this all day.  \r\r\n892,TONY STARK,That shield doesn't belong to you.  You don't deserve it. My father made that shield!  \r\r\n893,EVERETT ROSS,\"Meals at eight and five. Toilet privileges twice a day. Raise your voice, zap. Touch the glass, zap. You step out of line, you deal with me. Please, step out of line. Hmm?  So how does it feel? To spend all that time, all that effort . . . and, to see it fail so spectacularly?  \"\r\r\n894,HELMUT ZEMO,Did it?  \r\r\n895,TONY STARK,It's just the first pass.  \r\r\n896,JAMES RHODES,Yeah.  \r\r\n897,TONY STARK,Give me some feedback. Anything you can think of. Shock absorption. Lateral movement. Cup holder?  \r\r\n898,JAMES RHODES,You may wanna think about some AC down in . . .  \r\r\n899,TONY STARK,Let's go. I'll give you a hand.  \r\r\n900,JAMES RHODES,\"No, no, don't. Don't help me. Don't help me.  138. 138 combat missions. That's how many I've flown, Tony. Every one of them could've been my last, but I flew 'em. Because the fight needed to be fought. It's the same with these Accords. I signed because it was the right thing to do. And, yeah, this sucks. This is . . . this is a bad beat. But it hasn't change my mind. I don't think.  \"\r\r\n901,TONY STARK,You okay?  \r\r\n902,JAMES RHODES,Oh yeah.  \r\r\n903,FEDEX DRIVER STAN LEE,\"Are you Tony \"\"Stank\"\"?  \"\r\r\n904,JAMES RHODES,\"Yes, this is--this is Tony \"\"Stank\"\". You're in the right place. Thank you for that! I'm never dropping that, by the way. Table for one, Mr. \"\"Stank\"\". Please, by the bathroom.  \"\r\r\n905,STEVE ROGERS,\"Tony, I'm glad you're back at the compound. I don't like the idea of you rattling around a mansion by yourself. We all need family. The Avengers are yours, maybe more so than mine. I've been on my own since I was 18. I never really fit in anywhere, even in the army. My faith's in people, I guess. Individuals. And I'm happy to say that, for the most part, they haven't let me down. Which is why I can't let them down either. Locks can be replaced, but maybe they shouldn't. I know I hurt you, Tony. I guess I thought by not telling you about your parents I was sparing you, but I can see now that I was really sparing myself, and I'm sorry. Hopefully one day you can understand. I wish we agreed on the Accords, I really do. I know you're doing what you believe in, and that's all any of us can do. That's all any of us should . . .  \"\r\r\n906,FRIDAY,Priority call from Secretary Ross. There's been a breach at the Raft prison.  \r\r\n907,TONY STARK,\"Yeah, put him through.  \"\r\r\n908,SECRETARY ROSS,\"Tony, we have a problem.  \"\r\r\n909,TONY STARK,\"Ah, please hold.  \"\r\r\n910,SECRETARY ROSS,No. Don't . . .  \r\r\n911,STEVE ROGERS,\"So, no matter what. I promise you, if you need us, if you need me, I'll be there.  \"\r\r\n912,STEVE ROGERS,You sure about this?  \r\r\n913,BUCKY BARNES,\"I can't trust my own mind. So, until they figure out how to get this stuff out of my head I think going back under is the best thing . . . for everybody.  \"\r\r\n914,STEVE ROGERS,Thank you for this.  \r\r\n915,T'CHALLA,\"Your friend and my father, they were both victims. If I can help one of them find peace…  \"\r\r\n916,STEVE ROGERS,\"You know, If they find out he's here . . . they'll come for him.  \"\r\r\n917,T'CHALLA,Let them try.  \r\r\n918,MAY PARKER,So. Who was it? Who hit you?  \r\r\n919,PETER PARKER,\"Some guy. So itchy, man. God.  \"\r\r\n920,MAY PARKER,\"What's \"\"some guy's\"\" name?  \"\r\r\n921,PETER PARKER,\"Uh, Steve.  \"\r\r\n922,MAY PARKER,Steve? From 12-C? With the overbite?  \r\r\n923,PETER PARKER,\"No, no, no. You don't know him, he's from Brooklyn.  Ouch.  \"\r\r\n924,MAY PARKER,Well . . . I hope you got a few good licks in.  \r\r\n925,PETER PARKER,\"Yeah, I got quite a few in, actually. His friend was huge. Like huge.  That's way better. Thank you.  \"\r\r\n926,MAY PARKER,\"Okay, tough guy.  \"\r\r\n

<+>Response,Speaker,What is said\r\r\n1,GORDON,\"Harvey Dent was needed. He was everything Gotham has been crying out for. He was...a hero. Not the hero we deserved - the hero we needed. Nothing less than a knight, shining...  \"\r\r\n2,GORDON,But I knew Harvey Dent. I was...his friend. And it will be a very long time before someone inspires us the way he did. I believed in Harvey Dent.  \r\r\n3,CIA MAN,\"Dr. Pavel, I'm CIA. Dr. Pavel nods, nervous. CIA Man hands the Driver a briefcase.  \"\r\r\n4,DRIVER,\"He wasn't alone. CIA Man, confused, spots the Hooded Men. He turns to Dr. Pavel.  \"\r\r\n5,CIA MAN,You don't get to bring friends.  DR. PAVEL They are not my friends.  \r\r\n6,DRIVER,\"Don't worry, no charge for them.  \"\r\r\n7,CIA MAN,Why would I want them?  \r\r\n8,DRIVER,They were trying to grab your prize. They work for the mercenary. The masked man.  \r\r\n9,CIA MAN, Bane? The Driver nods. CIA Man turns to his Special Forces Men.  \r\r\n10,CIA MAN,Get 'em on board - I'll call it in.  \r\r\n11,CIA MAN,\"What are you doing in the middle of my operation?  Hooded Man 1 says nothing. CIA Man pulls out a handgun. The flight plan I just filed with the Agency lists me, my men, and Dr. Pavel here. But only one of you. CIA Man opens the cargo door. Special Forces hang Hooded Man 1 out into the howling wind - CIA Man shouts above the wind.  \"\r\r\n12,CIA MAN, \r\r\n13,FIRST ONE TO TALK GETS TO STAY ON,\r\r\n14,CIA MAN, HE DIDN'T FLY SO GOOD! WHO WANTS TO  \r\r\n15,CIA MAN, TELL ME ABOUT BANE! WHY DOES HE  WEAR THE MASK?!   The prisoner says nothing. CIA Man presses the gun to the man's hood - he cocks the gun...nothing.  \r\r\n16,CIA MAN, LOT OF LOYALTY FOR A HIRED GUN!    \r\r\n17,THIRD PRISONER,Or he's wondering why someone would shoot a man before throwing him out of an aeroplane.   CIA Man turns to the Third Prisoner. Shuts the cargo door.  \r\r\n18,CIA MAN,\"Wiseguy, huh? At least you can talk. Who are you?    \"\r\r\n19,THIRD PRISONER,\"We are nothing. We are the dirt beneath your feet. And no one cared who I was until I put on the mask...   CIA Man, wary, approaches the Third Prisoner - pulls off his hood, revealing a dark mask with a breathing apparatus. The eyes behind it are cold. Still. This is Bane.        \"\r\r\n20,BANE,Who we are does not matter. What matters is our plan.  \r\r\n21,CIA MAN,\"If I pull this off, will you die?  \"\r\r\n22,BANE,It would be extremely painful.    \r\r\n23,CIA MAN,You're a big guy -  \r\r\n24,BANE,For you.  \r\r\n25,CIA MAN,Was being caught part of your plan?  \r\r\n26,BANE,Of course. Dr. Pavel refused our offer in favor of yours. We had to know what he told you about us.  DR. PAVEL Nothing! I said nothing!  \r\r\n27,CIA MAN,Why not just ask him?  \r\r\n28,BANE,He would not have told us.  \r\r\n29,CIA MAN,You have methods.  \r\r\n30,BANE,\"Him, I need healthy. You present no such problem. CIA Man laughs for the Special Forces' benefit. A heavy bass tone is rising. The Sergeant looks out the window.  \"\r\r\n31,SERGEANT,Sir?  \r\r\n32,CIA MAN,\"Well congratulations, you got yourselves caught. What's the next step of your master plan?  \"\r\r\n33,BANE,Crashing this plane...  \r\r\n34,BANE,With no survivors. A Special Forces soldier spins around - an Armed Man is outside the window. Bang -  \r\r\n35,BANE,\"Friend. They expect one of us in the wreckage. The man nods, unhooks himself, takes Bane's arm.    HOODED MAN 2 Have we started the fire?  \"\r\r\n36,BANE,The fire rises.  \r\r\n37,BANE,\"Calm, Doctor. Now is not time for fear... Bane slides Dr. Pavel out of his seat. They hang in the vertical, windblown cabin. Bane takes out a detonator.  \"\r\r\n38,BANE,\"That comes later. Bane presses the detonator - the cabin drops from around them, revealing the terrifying drop to the peaks below. Dr. Pavel screams as they are hoisted up towards the transport, and we -  \"\r\r\n39,MAYOR,Harvey Dent Day may not be our oldest public holiday... ...moving past the enormous Gotham Bridge...  \r\r\n40,MAYOR,But we're here tonight because it's one of the most important... ...over the Gotham river to the Palisades on the far side...  \r\r\n41,MAYOR,\"Harvey Dent's uncompromising stand against organized crime and, yes, ultimately, his sacrifice, have made Gotham a safer place than it was at the time of his death, eight years ago... ...finding a party in the grounds of Wayne Manor. The Mayor addresses the wealthy and powerful of Gotham.  \"\r\r\n42,MAYOR,\"This city has seen a historic turnaround. No city is without crime. But this city is without organized crime because the Dent Act gave law enforcement teeth in its fight against the mob. Now people are talking about repealing the Dent Act. And to them I say...not on my watch. Enthusiastic applause as the Mayor wraps up. I want to thank the Wayne Foundation for hosting this event. I'm told Mr. Wayne couldn't be here tonight, but I'm sure he's with us in spirit...   High above, on a darkened balcony, a lone figure. Watching.  \"\r\r\n43,MAYOR,\"Now I'm going to give way to an important voice...   Down below at the bar, Commissioner Gordon examines some sheets of densely written paper. A Congressman muscles in.  \"\r\r\n44,CONGRESSMAN,Commissioner.  \r\r\n45,GORDON,Congressman.  \r\r\n46,CONGRESSMAN,\"Ever lay eyes on Wayne at one of these things? Gordon shakes his head. Gordon's Deputy Commissioner, Foley, cuts in.  \"\r\r\n47,FOLEY,No one has. Not in years.  \r\r\n48,MAYOR,\"He can tell you about the bad old days, when the criminals and corrupt ran this town with such a tight grasp that people put their faith in a murderous thug in a mask and a cape. A thug who showed his true nature when he betrayed the trust of this great man -  And murdered him in cold blood. The Congressman watches a tray of canapes breeze past, then grabs the ass of the maid carrying them. She freezes.    \"\r\r\n49,CONGRESSMAN,\"Sweetheart, not so fast with the chow.  \"\r\r\n50,MAID,Shrimp balls? The Congressman grabs two. The Maid moves off. The Congressman glances down at Gordon's papers.    \r\r\n51,MAYOR,Jim Gordon can tell you the truth about Harvey Dent...  \r\r\n52,CONGRESSMAN,\"Jesus, Gordon, is that your speech? We're gonna be here all night.  \"\r\r\n53,GORDON,\"Maybe the truth about Harvey isn't so simple, Congressman.    \"\r\r\n54,MAYOR,But I'll let him tell you himself - Commissioner Gordon? Applause. Gordon approaches the mike. Looks down at his long speech. Thinks.  \r\r\n55,GORDON,The truth...? \r\r\n56,CONGRESSMAN,Thank Christ for that...  \r\r\n57,GORDON,\"Maybe right now all you need to know is that there are a thousand inmates in Blackgate Prison as a direct result of the Dent Act. These are violent criminals, essential cogs in the organized crime machine that terrorized Gotham for so long. Maybe, for now, all I should say about Harvey Dent's death is this...it has not been for nothing. The figure on the balcony turns back into the mansion. People clap as Gordon leaves the mike. Gordon approaches Foley.    \"\r\r\n58,GORDON,The second shift reports in?  \r\r\n59,FOLEY,On your desk. But you should put in some more time with the Mayor -  \r\r\n60,GORDON,That's your department.   Gordon heads for the line of town cars in the gravel drive.  \r\r\n61,CONGRESSMAN,Anyone shown him the crime stats?  \r\r\n62,FOLEY,\"He goes by his gut, and it continues to bother him, whatever the numbers.  \"\r\r\n63,CONGRESSMAN,Must be popular with the wife.   \r\r\n64,FOLEY,Not really. She took the kids and moved to Cleveland.  \r\r\n65,CONGRESSMAN,He'll have plenty of time for visits. Mayor's dumping him in the spring.  \r\r\n66,FOLEY,Really? He's a hero.    \r\r\n67,CONGRESSMAN,\"War hero. This is peacetime. Stay smart, the job's yours.      \"\r\r\n68,ALFRED,\"Mr. Till, why are your people using the main stairs? Alfred places a glass of water on a tray next to a covered plate. Picks up the tray, looks around the chaotic kitchen.    \"\r\r\n69,ALFRED,Where's Mrs. Bolton?  \r\r\n70,MAID,\"She's up at the bar, sir. Can I help?   Alfred looks at the Maid. Hands her a key and the tray.  \"\r\r\n71,ALFRED,\"The East drawing room. Unlock the door, place the tray on the table, lock the door again. Nothing more.   The Maid nods. Takes the tray.    \"\r\r\n72,ALFRED,\"I'm sorry, Miss Tate, but I've tried. He won't see you.    \"\r\r\n73,MIRANDA,\"It's important, Mr. Pennyworth. Her accent is European. Hard to place.  \"\r\r\n74,ALFRED,\"Mr. Wayne is as determined to ignore important things as trivial ones.  MALE VOICE Don't take it personally, Miranda.   They turn to see a man in his fifties. Daggett.  \"\r\r\n75,DAGGETT,\"Everyone knows Wayne's holed up in there with eight-inch nails, peeing into Mason jars. Good of you to let me on the grounds.  \"\r\r\n76,ALFRED,\"The Dent Act is about all Gotham. Even you, Mr. Daggett. Miss Tate, always a pleasure. Alfred turns and walks off. Daggett smiles, glib.      \"\r\r\n77,DAGGETT,Why waste your time talking to the man who threw away your investment on some save-the-world vanity project? He can't help you get your money back. But I can.  \r\r\n78,MIRANDA,\"I could try explaining that a save-the-world project, vain or not, is worth investing in, whatever the return. I could try, Mr. Daggett, but you understand only money and the power you think it buys, so why waste my time, indeed?   She walks away. Daggett watches her go.    \"\r\r\n79,MAID,\"I'm, I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Wayne. It is Mr. Wayne, isn't it?   Wayne nods, gently. Limps towards her.  \"\r\r\n80,MAID,\"Although you don't have the long nails... Or facial scars... She trails off, embarrassed. Coy. She seems very young.  \"\r\r\n81,WAYNE,Is that what they say about me?   \r\r\n82,MAID,It's just that...nobody sees you...   Wayne approaches slowly. He nods at her pearl necklace.  \r\r\n83,WAYNE,\"That's a beautiful necklace. Reminds me of the one that belonged to my mother. It can't be the same one - her pearls are in this safe - He reaches out with his cane to press open a panel on the bureau, revealing a safe door... - which the manufacturer clearly explained is uncrackable.   ...which swings open with an awkward creak.  \"\r\r\n84,MAID,Oops. No one told me it was uncrackable.   The Maid suddenly seems more confident. Older.  \r\r\n85,WAYNE,I'm afraid I can't let you take those.   She smiles at him. Moves towards him.  \r\r\n86,MAID,\"Look, you wouldn't hit a woman any more than I would beat up a cripple. She kicks his cane from under him, smashes him down. Of course, sometimes exceptions have to be made.   The Maid vaults onto the bureau and up to a high window. Goodnight, Mr. Wayne. She flips backwards through the window. Wayne smiles, then rocks forward on his good leg and rises with athletic grace. He looks at the safe, notices something. Powder...    \"\r\r\n87,MAID,\"Can I have a ride? The Congressman, a little tipsy, looks at her hungrily.  \"\r\r\n88,CONGRESSMAN,You read my mind.    \r\r\n89,ALFRED,Miss Tate was asking to see you again.    \r\r\n90,WAYNE,She's very persistent.  \r\r\n91,ALFRED,\"And quite lovely, in case you were wondering.    \"\r\r\n92,WAYNE,I wasn't.  \r\r\n93,ALFRED,What are you doing?    \r\r\n94,WAYNE,Examining print dust. We've been robbed.  \r\r\n95,ALFRED,And this is your idea of raising the alarm?  \r\r\n96,WAYNE, She took the pearls. Tracking device and all.  \r\r\n97,ALFRED,She?  \r\r\n98,WAYNE,\"One of the maids, perhaps you should stop letting them in this side of the house.  \"\r\r\n99,ALFRED,\"Perhaps you should learn to make your own bed, then. Why are you dusting for prints?  \"\r\r\n100,WAYNE,I'm not. She was.  YOUNG VOICE Sir?  \r\r\n101,BLAKE,\"I didn't want to bother you up here, but they're looking for you.  \"\r\r\n102,GORDON,\"What's the problem, son?  \"\r\r\n103,BLAKE,Congressman Gilly's wife's been calling. He hasn't made it home from the Wayne Foundation event.  \r\r\n104,GORDON,That's a job for the police?  \r\r\n105,BLAKE,\"Sir, I've been a cop for a year and I've only logged half a dozen arrests. When you and Dent cleaned the streets you cleaned 'em good. Pretty soon we'll be chasing overdue library books. Gordon smiles at this. Blake looks at his stack of files.  \"\r\r\n106,BLAKE,But here you are. Like we're still at war...  \r\r\n107,GORDON,Old habits.  \r\r\n108,BLAKE,Or instinct.  \r\r\n109,GORDON,\"What's your name, son?  \"\r\r\n110,BLAKE,\"Blake, sir.  \"\r\r\n111,GORDON,\"You have something you want to ask me, Officer Blake?  \"\r\r\n112,BLAKE,\"It's that night. This night, eight years ago. The night Dent died.  \"\r\r\n113,GORDON,What about it?  \r\r\n114,BLAKE,\"The last confirmed sighting of the Batman. He murders those people, takes out two SWAT teams, breaks Dent's neck...then just vanishes?  \"\r\r\n115,GORDON,\"I'm not hearing a question, son.  \"\r\r\n116,BLAKE,Don't you want to know who we was? Gordon turns to look at the broken searchlight. He brushes his fingers across its rusted shell.  \r\r\n117,GORDON,I know exactly who he was. He was Batman.  \r\r\n118,GORDON,Let's go see about the Congressman's wife...  \r\r\n119,ALFRED,Master Wayne? Alfred's voice echoes through the vast mansion. No reply.  \r\r\n120,ALFRED,You haven't been down here in a long time...  \r\r\n121,WAYNE,\"Just trying to find out more about our jewel thief. I ran her prints from the photos she handled - Wayne pulls up a mug shot - a fat, male armed-robbery suspect. - but she was wearing someone else's fingerprints. She's good.  \"\r\r\n122,ALFRED,She may be. But we have the trace on the necklace.  \r\r\n123,WAYNE,\"We do, so I cross-referenced the address she went back to with police data on high-end B-and-E's...  \"\r\r\n124,WAYNE,\"She's good, but the ground is shrinking beneath her feet.  \"\r\r\n125,ALFRED,We should send the police before she fences the pearls.  \r\r\n126,WAYNE,She won't. She likes them too much. And they weren't what she was after.  \r\r\n127,ALFRED,What was she after?    \r\r\n128,WAYNE,\"My fingerprints. There was printer toner mixed with graphite on the safe. Gives you a good pull, and it's untraceable.  \"\r\r\n129,ALFRED,Fascinating. Maybe you should exchange notes over coffee.  \r\r\n130,WAYNE,Now you're trying to set me up with a jewel thief?  \r\r\n131,ALFRED,\"At this point, sir, I would set you up with a chimpanzee if I thought it would bring you back into the world.  \"\r\r\n132,WAYNE,There's nothing out there for me.  \r\r\n133,ALFRED,\"And that's the problem. You hung up the cape and cowl, but never moved on. You won't get out there and find a life. Find someone  \"\r\r\n134,WAYNE,\"I did find someone, Alfred.  \"\r\r\n135,ALFRED,\"I know. And then you lost them. That's part of living, sir. But you're not living - you're waiting. Hoping for things to go bad again.   Wayne says nothing. Remember when you left Gotham? Before all this. Before Batman. Seven years you were gone. Seven years I waited. Hoping that you wouldn't come back. Wayne looks at Alfred. Not understanding. Every year I took my holiday. I'd go to Florence. There's a cafe by the Arno... Any fine evening I would sit there and order a Fernet Branca... \"\r\r\n136,DWP MAN,\"They wash up a couple times a month. More when in gets colder - homeless sheltering in the tunnels. We had to pull him to clear the basin, but other than that we didn't touch him...   \"\r\r\n137,ROSS,What?  \r\r\n138,BLAKE,Name's Jimmy. He's at St. \r\r\n139,FATHER REILLY,Jimmy hadn't been here for months.  \r\r\n140,BLAKE,Why?  \r\r\n141,FATHER REILLY,\"You know why, Blake - he aged out. We don't have the resources to keep boys on after sixteen -  \"\r\r\n142,BLAKE,The Wayne Foundation gives money for that -  \r\r\n143,FATHER REILLY,Not for two years now.  \r\r\n144,BLAKE,\"He has a brother here, right?  \"\r\r\n145,FATHER REILLY,Mark. I'll tell him.  \r\r\n146,BLAKE,\"I'd like to, if that's okay.  \"\r\r\n147,BLAKE,I'm sorry.  \r\r\n148,BLAKE,What was he doing in the tunnels?  \r\r\n149,MARK,Lot of guys been going down the tunnels when they age out. Say you can live down there. Say there's work down there.  \r\r\n150,BLAKE,What kind of work are you gonna find in the sewers?  \r\r\n151,MARK,\"More than you can find up here, I guess. Blake considers this. Troubled.  \"\r\r\n152,STRYVER,You brought a date?  \r\r\n153,SELINA,I like having someone around to open doors for me.   \r\r\n154,SELINA,Right hand. No partials. Stryver slides a transparency out of the envelope. Holds it up to the light. Four perfect fingerprint transfers.  \r\r\n155,STRYVER,Very nice. He pockets the envelope.  \r\r\n156,SELINA,\"Not so fast, handsome. You got something for me?  \"\r\r\n157,STRYVER,\"Oh, yes.  \"\r\r\n158,SELINA,I don't know what you're going to do with Mr. Wayne's prints...but I'm guessing you'll need his thumb. As Stryver checks the envelope again -  \r\r\n159,SELINA,\"You don't count so good, huh?  \"\r\r\n160,STRYVER,I count fine. The Second Thug puts a gun to Selina's head.  \r\r\n161,STRYVER,\"In fact, I'm counting to ten right now... Selina looks in his eyes. The Thug cocks his gun. She blinks.  \"\r\r\n162,SELINA,\"Okay, okay -  She reaches for her purse. The Thug stops her, reaches in himself - pulls out a cellphone. Slides it across the table.  \"\r\r\n163,SELINA,My friend is waiting outside. Just hit 'send'...  \r\r\n164,JEN,Place is a little dead.  \r\r\n165,SELINA,\"It'll liven up in a minute, trust me.  \"\r\r\n166,JEN,Everything okay?  \r\r\n167,SELINA,Great. Catch you later. Jen leaves. Stryver checks the envelope. Satisfied.  \r\r\n168,SELINA,It would've been a lot easier to just give me what we agreed.  \r\r\n169,STRYVER,\"We can't have loose ends. And even in that dress, no one's going to miss you.  \"\r\r\n170,SELINA,No. But my friend over there...? Stryver looks at Selina's 'date' drooling into a bowl of nuts at the bar - he looks familiar...  \r\r\n171,SELINA,Every cop in the city's missing him.  \r\r\n172,STRYVER,Cute. But they're not gonna be looking in a place like this.  \r\r\n173,SELINA,I don't know... You did just use his cell phone.  \r\r\n174,SWAT,\"It's alright, Miss. Just stay down  - The SWATs barrel past, chasing the remaining Thugs back through the bar and out into the back alley. Selina smiles.  \"\r\r\n175,SELINA,\"Keep some pressure on that, sweetheart. She adjusts her dress in the broken mirror behind the bar. Moves for the door.    \"\r\r\n176,CONGRESSMAN,Call me?  \r\r\n177,SELINA,There's a man in there - he's bleeding!  \r\r\n178,BLAKE,\"It's okay, Miss. It's okay.  \"\r\r\n179,BLAKE,\"I've got the Congressman - bullet to the leg, but he's okay.  \"\r\r\n180,GORDON,Manhole!  \r\r\n181,GORDON,\"You three, down with me. You two, head down to cover the next exit -    \"\r\r\n182,SWAT,Where -?  \r\r\n183,GORDON,\"Get the DWP down here, now!   Gordon starts climbing down the ladder...    \"\r\r\n184,COP,Where's the DWP guy?    \r\r\n185,BLAKE,They went down there?  \r\r\n186,FOLEY,And Gordon took SWAT in after them.    \r\r\n187,BLAKE,\"Come on, we gotta get down there -    \"\r\r\n188,COP,\"That was a gas explosion, kid -  \"\r\r\n189,BLAKE,Gas? This is a sewer!  \r\r\n190,FOLEY,No one goes in there till we know what's down there.  28.      \r\r\n191,BLAKE,\"We know what's down there, sir. The Police Commissioner!  \"\r\r\n192,FOLEY,Somebody get the hothead out of here. And get me a DWP guy! Blake backs off. Gets an idea - goes for his patrol car.      \r\r\n193,BANE,Why are you here? The Thugs drop Gordon at Bane's feet.    THUG 1 Answer him! Bane slowly turns to the Thugs.     \r\r\n194,BANE,I'm asking you.  THUG 1 It's the Police Commissioner.    \r\r\n195,BANE,And you brought him down here?  THUG 2 We didn't know what to do. We -    \r\r\n196,BANE,\"You panicked. And your weakness costs three lives.  THUG 1 No, he's alone - Bane flips the Thug's chin up and to the side with a crack. Thug 1 drops. Bane turns to Thug 2.  \"\r\r\n197,BANE,\"Search him. Then I will kill you. The Thug, terrified, pulls out Gordon's badge, wallet, gun...and the folded papers of the speech he did not read. Bane takes these one by one with quick glances. He stops at the papers. Unfolds them...   As he reads, Gordon rolls off the steps, dropping into the rushing flow of water - gunshots ring out...  THUG 2 He's dead.   Thug 2 trails off as Bane looks up from the papers...  \"\r\r\n198,BANE,Then show me his body.    THUG 2 That water runs to any one of the outflows - we'd never find him. Bane turns to the Lead Mercenary.    \r\r\n199,BANE,\"Give me your GPS. Lead Mercenary hands him a GPS - Bane tucks it into Thug 2's jacket, zips it up like a mother sending her kid to school.      \"\r\r\n200,BANE,\"Follow him.  THUG 2 Follow him?   Bane shoots Thug 2, kicks him into the water. Turns to Lead Mercenary.  \"\r\r\n201,BANE,Track him. Make sure both bodies will not be found. Then brick up the south tunnel.    \r\r\n202,BLAKE,I need to see Bruce Wayne.    \r\r\n203,ALFRED,\"I'm sorry, Mr. Wayne doesn't take unscheduled calls. Even from police officers.    \"\r\r\n204,BLAKE,\"And if I go get a warrant, in the investigation of Harvey Dent's murder? Would that still count as unscheduled?      \"\r\r\n205,WAYNE,\"What can I do for you, officer?  \"\r\r\n206,BLAKE,Commissioner Gordon's been shot.    \r\r\n207,WAYNE,I'm sorry to hear that -  \r\r\n208,BLAKE,He chased a gunman down into the sewers. When I pulled him out he was babbling about an underground army. A masked man called 'Bane'.  \r\r\n209,WAYNE,Shouldn't you be telling this to your superior officers?  \r\r\n210,BLAKE,I did. One of them asked if he saw any giant alligators down there. He needs you. He needs the Batman.    \r\r\n211,WAYNE,If Commissioner Gordon thinks I'm the Batman he must be in a bad way  -    \r\r\n212,BLAKE,\"He doesn't know or care who you are.  But we've met before. When I was a kid. At the orphanage. See, my mom died when I was small. Car accident, I don't really remember it. But a couple of years later my dad was shot over a gambling debt. I remember that just fine.  Not a lot of people who know what it feels like, do they? To be angry. In your bones. People understand, foster parents understand. For a while. Then they expect the angry kid to do what he knows he can never do. To move on. To forget.   Wayne stares at Blake.  \"\r\r\n213,BLAKE,\"So they stopped understanding and sent the angry kid to a boys' home - St. Swithin's. Used to be funded by the Wayne Foundation. See, I figured it out too late. You have to hide the anger. Practice smiling in the mirror. Like putting on a mask. You showed up one day in a cool car, pretty girl on your arm.       \"\r\r\n214,BLAKE,\"We were so excited - Bruce Wayne, billionaire orphan. We made up stories about you. Legends. The other boys' stories were just that. But when I saw you I knew who you really were... I'd seen that look on your face. Same one I taught myself. Blake gets up to leave. Wayne is lost in thought.    \"\r\r\n215,BLAKE,\"I don't know why you took the fall for Dent's murder, but I'm still a believer in the Batman. Even if you're not.    \"\r\r\n216,WAYNE,Why did you say your boys' home used to be funded by the Wayne Foundation?    \r\r\n217,BLAKE,Because the money stopped. Might be time to get some fresh air and start paying attention to the details. Some of those details might need your help.    \r\r\n218,WAYNE,You checked that name? 'Bane' -  \r\r\n219,ALFRED,Ran it through some databases. He's a mercenary. No other known name. Never been seen or photographed without a mask. He and his men were behind a coup in West Africa that secured mining operations for our friend John Daggett.    \r\r\n220,WAYNE,Now Daggett's brought them here?  \r\r\n221,ALFRED,It would seem so. I'll keep digging.    Alfred turns to leave.  \r\r\n222,WAYNE,Why did the Wayne Foundation stop funding boys' homes in the city?    \r\r\n223,ALFRED,The Foundation is funded from the profits of Wayne Enterprises... There have to be some.    \r\r\n224,WAYNE,\"Time to talk to Mr. Fox, I think.  \"\r\r\n225,ALFRED,I'll get him on the phone -    \r\r\n226,WAYNE,No. Do we still have any cars around the place?  \r\r\n227,ALFRED,One or two.  \r\r\n228,WAYNE,And I need an appointment at the hospital. About my leg.    \r\r\n229,ALFRED,\"Which hospital, sir?  \"\r\r\n230,WAYNE,Whichever one Jim Gordon's in.   Alfred is less excited by this part of the request.    \r\r\n231,MIRANDA,\"Mr. Fox, I believe in what Mr. Wayne was trying to do...      \"\r\r\n232,MIRANDA,I'm only asking for explanations because I think I can help.  \r\r\n233,FOX,I'll pass along your request. Next time I see him. Miranda catches something in this.  \r\r\n234,MIRANDA,He doesn't talk to you either?  \r\r\n235,FOX,Let's just say that Bruce Wayne has his...eccentricities.  \r\r\n236,MIRANDA,\"Mr. Fox, are you aware that John Daggett is trying to acquire shares in Wayne Enterprises?  \"\r\r\n237,FOX,I was not. But it wouldn't do him any good - Mr. Wayne still retains a clear majority. Miranda leaves. Fox moves into his office - stops.  \r\r\n238,FOX,\"Bruce Wayne. As I live and breathe. Wayne rises, pushing hard on his cane.  \"\r\r\n239,FOX,What brings you out of cryo-sleep Mr. Wayne?  \r\r\n240,WAYNE,I see you haven't lost your sense of humor...even if you have lost most of my money.  \r\r\n241,FOX,\"Actually, you did that yourself. See, if you funnel the entire R and D budget for five years into a fusion project that you then mothball, your company is unlikely to thrive.  \"\r\r\n242,WAYNE,Even with -  \r\r\n243,FOX,\"A wildly sophisticated CEO, yes. Wayne Enterprises is running out of time. And Daggett is moving in.  \"\r\r\n244,WAYNE,What're my options?  \r\r\n245,FOX,If you're not willing to turn your machine on -  \r\r\n246,WAYNE,\"I can't, Lucius.  \"\r\r\n247,FOX,\"Then sit tight. Your majority keeps Daggett at arm's length while we figure out a future for the energy program with Miranda Tate - she's supported your project all the way. She's smart, and quite lovely.  \"\r\r\n248,WAYNE,\"You too, Lucius?  \"\r\r\n249,FOX,\"We all just want what's best for you, Bruce. Show her the machine.  \"\r\r\n250,WAYNE,I'll think it over.  \r\r\n251,FOX,Anything else?  \r\r\n252,WAYNE,\"No, why?  \"\r\r\n253,FOX,These conversations always used to end with some...unusual requests.  \r\r\n254,WAYNE,I retired.  \r\r\n255,FOX,\"Let me show you some stuff, anyway. Fox hits a button - the bookcase opens into a hidden elevator.  \"\r\r\n256,WAYNE,I figured you'd have shut this place down.  \r\r\n257,FOX,\"It was always shut down, officially.  \"\r\r\n258,WAYNE,But all this new stuff?  \r\r\n259,FOX,\"After your father died, Wayne Enterprises set up fourteen different defense subsidiaries. I've spent years shuttering them and consolidating all the prototypes under one roof. My roof.  \"\r\r\n260,WAYNE,Why?  \r\r\n261,FOX,\"Stop them falling into the wrong hands. Besides, I thought someone might get some use out of them... Wayne shakes his head.  \"\r\r\n262,FOX,Sure I can't tempt you to something? Pneumatic crampons? Infrared lenses? Least let me get you something for that leg.  \r\r\n263,WAYNE,It's fine the use it gets these days.  \r\r\n264,FOX,\"Well, then I have just the thing for an eccentric billionaire who doesn't like to walk... Fox opens a door - we glimpse a sleek vehicle. Wayne's eyes light up.  \"\r\r\n265,WAYNE,Now you're just showing off.  \r\r\n266,FOX,Defense Department project for tight-geometry urban pacification. Rotors configured for maneuvering between buildings without recirculation.  \r\r\n267,WAYNE,What's it called?  \r\r\n268,FOX,\"It has a long and uninteresting Wayne Enterprises designation. So I took to calling it the Bat. And yes, Mr. Wayne, it does come in black. Wayne touches its sleek side. Marveling.  \"\r\r\n269,FOX,Works great except for the autopilot.  \r\r\n270,WAYNE,What's wrong with that?  \r\r\n271,FOX,Software-based instability. Take a better mind than mine to fix it.  \r\r\n272,WAYNE,Better mind?  \r\r\n273,FOX,\"I was trying to be modest. A less busy mind. Yours, perhaps. Wayne looks wistfully at the machine. Turns away.  \"\r\r\n274,WAYNE,\"I told you. I retired, Lucius.  \"\r\r\n275,DOCTOR,I've seen worse cartilage in knees   \r\r\n276,WAYNE,That's good -  \r\r\n277,DOCTOR,\"No, that's because there is no cartilage in your knee. And not much of any use in your elbows and shoulders. Between that and the scar tissue on your kidneys, residual concussive damage to your brain tissue and general scarred-over quality of your body...  I cannot recommend that you go heli-skiing. About the only part of your body that looks healthy is your liver, so if you're bored I recommend you take up drinking, Mr. Wayne.  \"\r\r\n278,GORDON,We were in this together. Then you were gone...  \r\r\n279,WAYNE,The Batman wasn't needed anymore. We won.  \r\r\n280,GORDON,Built on a lie. Our lie. Now there's evil rising from where we tried to bury it. Nobody will listen... The Batman has to come back.  \r\r\n281,WAYNE,What if he doesn't exist anymore?  \r\r\n282,GORDON,He must. He must.  \r\r\n283,JEN,I told you - money first -  \r\r\n284,YUPPIE,\"Goddammit, you took my wallet!    \"\r\r\n285,SELINA,Get out.    \r\r\n286,YUPPIE,She took my wallet! Selina twists his arm behind him in a blinding move.  \r\r\n287,SELINA,\"Now. She releases the Yuppie, who moves off down the stairs. Selina turns to Jen. Who is examining a wallet.  \"\r\r\n288,SELINA,\"I told you not to try it with the assholes, Jen.  \"\r\r\n289,JEN,They're all assholes.   \r\r\n290,SELINA,\"Okay, the assholes who hit.  \"\r\r\n291,JEN,\"I don't know what he's so upset about, he only had sixty bucks in here.  \"\r\r\n292,SELINA,Probably the watch.    \r\r\n293,YOUNG WOMAN,Watch? Selina opens her hand and gives Jen the Yuppie's Rolex.      \r\r\n294,PAPARAZZI,\"Another stiff too old to climb out of his sports car.  PAPARAZZI 2 No, that's Bruce Wayne! Hey, Wayne, where you been hiding? Lenses swing onto Wayne, who pushes a button on his key fob - a pulse. The cameras die. Wayne heads to the door.    \"\r\r\n295,WAYNE,I'm not sure if my assistant put me on the guest list -  \r\r\n296,GREETER,\"Right through here, Mr. Wayne...      \"\r\r\n297,WAYNE,\"Miss Tate, isn't it?  \"\r\r\n298,MIRANDA,\"Even before you became a recluse, you never came to these things...  \"\r\r\n299,WAYNE,\"True. Proceeds go to the big fat spread, not the cause. It's not about charity, it's about feeding the ego of whichever society hag laid it on.  \"\r\r\n300,MIRANDA,\"Actually, this is my party, Mr. Wayne.  \"\r\r\n301,WAYNE,Oh.  \r\r\n302,MIRANDA,\"And the proceeds will go where they should, because I paid for the big fat spread myself.  \"\r\r\n303,WAYNE,That's very generous of you.  \r\r\n304,MIRANDA,You have to invest to restore balance to the world. Take our clean-energy project...    \r\r\n305,WAYNE,Sometimes the investment doesn't pay off. Sorry.    \r\r\n306,MIRANDA,\"You have a practiced apathy, Mr. Wayne. But a man who doesn't care about the world doesn't spend half his fortune on a plan to save it... \"\r\r\n307,MIRANDA,\"Have a good evening, Mr. Wayne. Wayne watches Miranda glide away. Then turns to Selina.  \"\r\r\n308,WAYNE,\"Mind if I cut in? Rich Twit turns, annoyed - Wayne hands him his cane. Takes Selina by the waist. She glares at him.  \"\r\r\n309,WAYNE,You don't seem very happy to see me.  \r\r\n310,SELINA,You were supposed to be a shut-in.    \r\r\n311,WAYNE,Felt like some fresh air.  \r\r\n312,SELINA,Why didn't you call the police?    \r\r\n313,WAYNE,I have a powerful friend who deals \r\r\n314,SELINA,Yeah? Who are you pretending to be?  \r\r\n315,WAYNE,\"Bruce Wayne, eccentric billionaire. Who's your date?  \"\r\r\n316,SELINA,\"His wife's in Ibiza. She left her diamonds behind, though. Worried they'd get stolen.    \"\r\r\n317,WAYNE,It's pronounced 'Ibeetha'. You wouldn't want these folks realizing you're a crook not a social climber.    \r\r\n318,SELINA,\r\r\n319,WAYNE,I doubt you care what anyone in this room thinks about you.  \r\r\n320,SELINA,\"Don't condescend, Mr. Wayne. You don't know a thing about me.  \"\r\r\n321,WAYNE,\"Well, Selina Kyle, I know you came here from your walk-up in Old Town - modest place for a master jewel thief. Which means either you're saving for your retirement - or you're in deep with the wrong people.    \"\r\r\n322,SELINA,You don't get to judge me because you were born in the master bedroom of Wayne Manor.  \r\r\n323,WAYNE,\"Actually, I was born in the Regency Room.  \"\r\r\n324,SELINA,I started off doing what I had to. Once you've done what you had to they'll never let you do what you want to.  \r\r\n325,WAYNE,Start fresh.    \r\r\n326,SELINA,There's no fresh start in today's world. Any twelve-year-old with a cell phone could find out what you did. Everything we do is collated and quantified. Everything sticks. We are the sum of our mistakes.      \r\r\n327,WAYNE,Or our achievements.  \r\r\n328,SELINA,The mistakes stick better. Trust me.    \r\r\n329,WAYNE,You think that justifies stealing?  \r\r\n330,SELINA,I take what I need to from those who have more than enough. I don't stand on the shoulders of people with less.  \r\r\n331,WAYNE,Robin Hood?  \r\r\n332,SELINA,I'd do more to help someone than most of the people in this room. Than you.    \r\r\n333,WAYNE,Maybe you're assuming too much.  \r\r\n334,SELINA,Or maybe you're being unrealistic about what's really in your pants other than your wallet.  \r\r\n335,WAYNE,Ouch.    \r\r\n336,SELINA,You think all this can last? Wayne glances around at the sumptuous party.    \r\r\n337,SELINA,\"There's a storm coming, Mr. Wayne. You and your friends better batten down the hatches, because when it hits you're all gonna wonder how you ever thought you could live so large and leave so little to the rest of us.  \"\r\r\n338,WAYNE,Sounds like you're looking forward to it.     \r\r\n339,SELINA,I'm adaptable.  \r\r\n340,WAYNE,\"These pearls do look better on you then they did in my safe...   Wayne rolls her into his shoulder - reaches up to the back of her neck, unclasps the necklace. But I still can't let you keep them.   The pearls slide off her neck into his other hand. Selina looks at him. Angry. Then kisses him, hard, and disappears into the crowd. Wayne's cane reappears.  \"\r\r\n341,RICH TWIT, \r\r\n342,WAYNE,Not likely.      \r\r\n343,WAYNE,I must have lost my ticket -  \r\r\n344,VALET,\"Your wife said you were taking a cab home, sir.    \"\r\r\n345,WAYNE,My wife?    \r\r\n346,ALFRED,\"Just you, sir?   Wayne gives him a withering glare.  \"\r\r\n347,FOX,This is Fox.  \r\r\n348,WAYNE,Remember those 'unusual requests' I used to make?  \r\r\n349,FOX,\"I knew it! Up front, Alfred listens. Concerned.  \"\r\r\n350,ALFRED,\"You've got the wrong leg, sir.  \"\r\r\n351,WAYNE,You start with the good limb so it learns your optimum muscle patterns.  \r\r\n352,ALFRED,It is terribly painful?  \r\r\n353,WAYNE,\"You're welcome to try it, Alfred.  \"\r\r\n354,ALFRED,\"Happy watching, thank you, sir. Wayne shouts as the brace clicks home. He gets to his feet.  \"\r\r\n355,WAYNE,\"Not bad - Wayne executes a perfect roundhouse, knocking out a brick. Not bad at all.   Alfred picks up the brick. Considers it. Uneasy. He follows Wayne across the bridge to the cube.  \"\r\r\n356,ALFRED,\"Master Wayne, if you're considering going back out there you need to hear some rumors surrounding Bane.  \"\r\r\n357,WAYNE,I'm all ears.    \r\r\n358,ALFRED,\"There is a prison. In a more ancient part of the world. A pit. Where men are thrown to suffer and die. But sometimes, a man rises from the darkness. Sometimes...the pit sends something back.  \"\r\r\n359,WAYNE,Bane.  \r\r\n360,ALFRED,Born and raised in a hell on earth.  \r\r\n361,WAYNE,Born in a prison?  \r\r\n362,ALFRED,No one knows why. Or how he escaped. But they know who trained him one he did...R¯'s al Gh¯l. Your  \r\r\n363,A U,mentor.   Wayne takes this in. Shocked.  \r\r\n364,ALFRED,\"He plucked Bane from a dark corner of the earth and trained him in the blackest disciplines of combat, deception and endurance. Just like you.  \"\r\r\n365,WAYNE,Bane was a member of the League of Shadows.  \r\r\n366,ALFRED,\r\r\n367,A,al Gh¯l is not to be trifled with.  \r\r\n368,U,  \r\r\n369,WAYNE,I didn't realize I was known for trifling with criminals.  \r\r\n370,ALFRED,That was then. And you can strap up your leg and put the mask back on. But it won't make you what you were.  \r\r\n371,WAYNE,Which was?  \r\r\n372,ALFRED,Someone whose anger at death made him value all life. Even his own.  \r\r\n373,WAYNE,\"If this man is all the things you say he is, then this city needs me. The Batsuit emerges from the cube.  \"\r\r\n374,ALFRED,\"Yes, this city needs Bruce Wayne. Your resources, your knowledge...not your body. Not your life. That time has passed.    \"\r\r\n375,WAYNE,\"I tried helping as Bruce Wayne, Alfred. And I failed.  \"\r\r\n376,ALFRED,\"You can fail as Bruce Wayne. As Batman, you can't afford to.  \"\r\r\n377,WAYNE,That's what you're afraid of - that if I go back out there I'll fail.    \r\r\n378,ALFRED,No. I'm afraid that you want to. Wayne looks at Alfred. Then turns to examine the Batsuit.     \r\r\n379,FEMALE SECURITY GUARD,\r\r\n380,BANE,Why else would you people be here? Bane grabs Trader 1 by the throat and drags him across the floor to an online automated trades terminal... He puts the man's thumb onto the print reader - the screen lights up.    \r\r\n381,BANE,\"Enter your password. Or I send these men to your home.   Trader 1, terrified, types in his password. Outside, sirens. Shoeshine man pulls out a USB drive with an antenna - plugs it into the computer - figures race across the screen...    \"\r\r\n382,BLAKE,\"Move it, now! We've got a situation.  \"\r\r\n383,CONSTRUCTION WORKER,Where can I move it?!    \r\r\n384,BLAKE,\"That way! Blake points - but SWAT vehicles pile in, blocking.      \"\r\r\n385,BLAKE,\"Get in your vehicle and stay there! Foley and the SWAT Commander, Allen, approach the entrance. The Market Security Chief walks up, frantic.    \"\r\r\n386,SECURITY CHIEF,You've gotta get in there!  \r\r\n387,FOLEY,This is a hostage situation -    \r\r\n388,SECURITY CHIEF,It's a robbery! They've got direct access to the online trading desk.  \r\r\n389,FOLEY,I'm not risking my men for your  MONEY -  \r\r\n390,SECURITY CHIEF,\"It's not our money, it's everyone's!    \"\r\r\n391,ALLEN,Really? Mine's in my mattress.  \r\r\n392,SECURITY CHIEF,\"If you don't shut these guys down, the stuffing in that mattress might be worth a whole lot less, pal.  \"\r\r\n393,FOLEY,Cut the fiber line - shut down the cell tower. That'll slow them down.      \r\r\n394,SHOESHINE MAN,They cut the fiber. Cell's working.  \r\r\n395,BANE,For now. How much longer does the program need?  \r\r\n396,SHOESHINE MAN,Eight minutes.    \r\r\n397,BANE,\"Time to go mobile. Shoeshine Man picks up the laptop, slips it into his pack...      \"\r\r\n398,ALLEN,\"Get the barriers up - no more in and out on this street! Steel wedge-shaped barriers rise up at the mouth of the street. A Sniper watches the doors through a thermal scope. Six large heat signatures bloom, too big for people...    \"\r\r\n399,SNIPER,\"I've got something - The door explodes. SWATs duck, six sportbikes race out and leap the ramp-like barricades, sending SWATs scattering. Cops scramble to pull their vehicles out to give chase.    \"\r\r\n400,ROOKIE COP,\"Shoot the tires!   A Veteran Cop sights a shot, but the Traders are in the way.  \"\r\r\n401,VETERAN COP,No shot!      \r\r\n402,FOLEY,\"Back off, back off! They've got hostages!      \"\r\r\n403,ROOKIE COP,\"What's going on with the lights? The Veteran Cop looks back - streetlights and headlights are dying one after another. The darkness is chasing them - the darkness hits them. Their lights, sirens, and engine die...   And, out of the silence, a dark shape roars past -  \"\r\r\n404,VETERAN COP,It can't be...    \r\r\n405,ROOKIE COP,The hell was that?!  \r\r\n406,VETERAN COP,\"Oh boy. You're in for a show tonight, son.      \"\r\r\n407,FOLEY,\"Let's roll, they've spotted the Batman!    \"\r\r\n408,FOLEY, \r\r\n409,FOLEY,I'm gonna do what Gordon never could.  \r\r\n410,BLAKE,What's that?    \r\r\n411,FOLEY,I'm gonna take down the Batman.  \r\r\n412,BLAKE,\"Sir, what about the armed robbers?   Foley ignores him.     \"\r\r\n413,SPOTTER, \r\r\n414,SPOTTER, \r\r\n415,FOLEY,Negative! Stay on the Batman!  \r\r\n416,BLAKE,But he's getting away!  \r\r\n417,FOLEY, \r\r\n418,TV ANNOUNCER,\"People aren't saying much - frankly, they're too busy - but all signs suggest that what we're  \"\r\r\n419,CATWOMAN,\"Well, what do you know? Catwoman opens the safe. Nothing inside. She frowns.      \"\r\r\n420,BATMAN, WHAT WERE YOU STEALING?!   Shoeshine Man stares. Unafraid. Batman rips the computer from his pack. The screen reads:  \r\r\n421,APPLICATION COMPLETE,\"  Blinding light and noise as police choppers descend - sirens everywhere. Batman grabs the USB drive from the laptop. He jumps on the Bat-Pod - pauses, taking in the sight of thousands of police, cars, choppers, dogs, closing in.     POLICE VOICE  \"\r\r\n422,DAGGETT,After eight years he has to pick tonight...    \r\r\n423,STRYVER,\"He's drawing the cops off Bane... Daggett watches, intrigued.      \"\r\r\n424,FOLEY,How did you let him go?!  \r\r\n425,COP, \r\r\n426,FOLEY,\"And you don't?! We're not letting one nut with a bad attitude and some fancy gadgets run this town down, you hear me?!    \"\r\r\n427,COP, \r\r\n428,FOLEY, \r\r\n429,FOLEY,\"Like a rat in a trap, gentlemen... Foley reaches for a loudhailer. VARRROOOOM!! A noise from the alley that none of the cops have heard before...  \"\r\r\n430,VETERAN COP,\"You might have the wrong animal there, sir -   Spotlights smash on and a massive dark cyclone roars out of the alley, spinning the choppers sideways, dual rotor downdraft forcing all the cops to the ground. The Bat, now black, thunders up and over the entire Gotham PD. Blake slides up to Foley. Dry.    \"\r\r\n431,BLAKE,Are you sure that was him? Foley looks at Blake. Thrusts the loudhailer at him.      \r\r\n432,ANNOUNCER, \r\r\n433,STRYVER,\"Bane says the Batman interfered, but the task was accomplished.  \"\r\r\n434,DAGGETT,What about the men they arrested?    \r\r\n435,STRYVER,\"He says, and I quote, they would die before talking.  \"\r\r\n436,DAGGETT, \r\r\n437,DAGGETT,And can we get some girls in here?  \r\r\n438,CATWOMAN,\"Careful what you wish for. Catwoman grabs him, throws him across the room. His back slams against the wall - he draws a gun, but - WHACK! - Catwoman pins his wrist to the wall at shoulder height using the high heel of her boot. He whimpers as she leans in.  \"\r\r\n439,CATWOMAN,Cat got your tongue? She plucks the gun from his trembling hand.  \r\r\n440,DAGGETT,You dumb bitch.    \r\r\n441,CATWOMAN,Nobody ever accused me of being dumb.     \r\r\n442,DAGGETT,Dumb to show up here tonight.  \r\r\n443,CATWOMAN,I want what you owe me -   Click - Stryver has a gun to her head.  \r\r\n444,DAGGETT,'I want' never gets...   Stryver looks appreciatively at Catwoman as she lowers her leg...  \r\r\n445,STRYVER,\"Nice outfit...those heels make it tough to walk?   Catwoman digs her stiletto into his calf, hard. He screams.  \"\r\r\n446,CATWOMAN,\"I don't know, do they?   Catwoman spins, disarms Stryver, grabs Daggett.  \"\r\r\n447,CATWOMAN,So where is it?  \r\r\n448,DAGGETT,Where's what?  \r\r\n449,CATWOMAN,The program. The 'Clean Slate'.  \r\r\n450,DAGGETT,\"Oh, yeah - the ultimate tool for a master thief with a record. I don't have it. The Bodyguard bursts in, gun drawn. Catwoman, holding Daggett, spins, kicking the window with the point of her heel. The glass shatters. She pulls Daggett through the window. He screams - they drop...    \"\r\r\n451,CATWOMAN,Where is it?    \r\r\n452,DAGGETT,The 'Clean Slate'? Type in a name and date of birth and within a couple hours that person ceases to exist in any database? Little too good to be true.  \r\r\n453,CATWOMAN,You're lying. Rykin Data took it to prototype stage -    \r\r\n454,DAGGETT,\"That's why I bought them. But they had nothing. It was a gangland myth.   Catwoman leans back from Daggett, taking this in... Shapes drop onto the rooftop. Emerge from fire exits. They're not Daggett's bodyguards, these are Bane's men... Catwoman holds Daggett by the throat, threatening him.  \"\r\r\n455,CATWOMAN,Stay back! They continue to approach. One of them screws a silencer onto his gun.  \r\r\n456,CATWOMAN,\"I'm not bluffing!  VOICE They know...   All eyes search for the source of the voice. Catwoman spots it - a dark shape, crouched on the roof above: Batman.  \"\r\r\n457,BATMAN,\"They just don't care.   As the Mercenary with the silencer looks up, Catwoman leaps forward, grabs his gun. Batman drops into the middle of the fray, fighting back Mercenaries at Catwoman's back - she fires at one, clipping him, he drops. She spins aiming at another's head - Batman yanks her arm down, forcing her to miss the Mercenary. Batman takes him out with a kick.   \"\r\r\n458,CATWOMAN,You've got to be kidding.  \r\r\n459,BATMAN,No guns. No killing.    \r\r\n460,CATWOMAN,\"Where's the fun in that? As more mercenaries come out onto the roof, Batman runs for the far edge.  \"\r\r\n461,BATMAN,\"Come on! Catwoman follows, confused, as Batman leaps off the roof. She gets to the edge, pauses to look down into the alley - sees the black angular roof of the Bat, cockpit open. Shots impact around her - she leaps, landing hard, but gracefully on the back of the vehicle, slides into the cockpit. As the engines thunder into life, and the canopy hisses shut, taking bullets from above.    \"\r\r\n462,CATWOMAN,My mother warned me about getting into cars with strange men -  \r\r\n463,BATMAN,\"This isn't a car. Catwoman flinches as the Bat thunders into the sky, downdraft forcing the Mercenaries down onto the roof, all but one, who walks slowly across the roof, strong against the wind...Bane. He watches the Bat roar off into the night.      \"\r\r\n464,CATWOMAN,See you around - Batman steps down after her.    \r\r\n465,BATMAN,You're welcome.  \r\r\n466,CATWOMAN,I had it under control.  63.    \r\r\n467,BATMAN,Those weren't street thugs - they were trained killers. I saved your life. In return I need to know what you did with Bruce Wayne's fingerprints. Catwoman looks at him. Considering.  \r\r\n468,CATWOMAN,Wayne wasn't kidding about a 'powerful friend'. I sold his prints to Daggett. For something that doesn't even exist.  \r\r\n469,BATMAN,I doubt many people get the better of you.  \r\r\n470,CATWOMAN,\"Hey, when a girl's desperate...    \"\r\r\n471,BATMAN,What were they going to do with them?  \r\r\n472,CATWOMAN,\"I don't know. But Daggett seemed pretty interested in that mess at the stock market. Batman considers this. A police chopper sweeps past, searching. Batman turns to it. Then turns back.    \"\r\r\n473,BATMAN,Miss Kyle -? But she is gone. So that's what that feels like.      \r\r\n474,ALFRED,Very inconspicuous. Shall I tell the neighbors you got yourself a new leaf-blower?  64.      \r\r\n475,WAYNE,\"We bought all the neighbors. Alfred takes the cowl from him, then the cape, as they walk.  \"\r\r\n476,ALFRED,\"From the look of the television coverage, you seem to have your taste for wanton destruction back.  \"\r\r\n477,WAYNE,\r\r\n478,ALFRED,Shouldn't the police be gathering the evidence?    \r\r\n479,WAYNE,They don't have the tools to analyze it.  \r\r\n480,ALFRED,They would if you gave them to them  -  \r\r\n481,WAYNE,One man's tool is another man's weapon.    \r\r\n482,ALFRED,\"In your mind, perhaps. But there aren't many things you couldn't turn into a weapon.    \"\r\r\n483,WAYNE,Alfred. Enough. The police weren't getting it done -  \r\r\n484,ALFRED,Perhaps they would've if you haven't made a sideshow of yourself.  \r\r\n485,WAYNE,Perhaps you're upset you were wrong.  \r\r\n486,ALFRED,Wrong?  65.      \r\r\n487,WAYNE,You thought I didn't have it in me. Alfred looks at him. Puts down the cape and cowl.  \r\r\n488,ALFRED,You don't. You lead a bloated police force on a merry chase with some fancy new toys from Fox. What about when you come up against him. What then?   Alfred points to the monitor - Wayne sees Bane killing...  \r\r\n489,WAYNE,\"I'll fight harder, I always have.    \"\r\r\n490,ALFRED,When you had something to fight for. What are you fighting for now? Not your life. Wayne moves to switch off the monitor. Alfred grabs his hand.  \r\r\n491,ALFRED,\"Take a good look. At his speed, his ferocity, His training. I see the power of belief. Of the fanatic. I see the League of Shadows resurgent.  \"\r\r\n492,WAYNE,You said he was excommunicated.    \r\r\n493,ALFRED,By R¯'s al Gh¯l. Who leads them  \r\r\n494,A U,now?  \r\r\n495,WAYNE,R¯'s al Gh¯l was the League of  \r\r\n496,A U,\"Shadows. And I beat him. Bane's just a mercenary, and we have to find out what he's up to. Wayne plugs the USB in, hits keys. Text scrolls.    \"\r\r\n497,WAYNE,\"Trades of some kind. Coded... The screen blanks, a thumb print appears.  66.      \"\r\r\n498,ALFRED,Is that -?  \r\r\n499,WAYNE,\"Mine. Courtesy of Selina Kyle.   Wayne pulls out the USB, rises. Get this to Fox - he can crack the code and tell us what trades they were executing.   Alfred looks at Wayne. Takes the USB.    \"\r\r\n500,ALFRED,I'll get this to Fox. But no more. Wayne hears his tone of voice. Turns to him.    \r\r\n501,ALFRED,I've sewn you up and set your bones...but I won't bury you. I've buried enough members of the Wayne family.    \r\r\n502,WAYNE,You'd abandon me?  \r\r\n503,ALFRED,You see only one end to your story. Leaving is all I have to make you understand: you aren't Batman anymore - you have to find another way. You used to talk about finishing. About life beyond that awful cave -    \r\r\n504,WAYNE,Rachel died knowing we'd decided to be together. That was my life beyond this cave and I can't just move on. She didn't. She couldn't.   Alfred considers this. Looks away.  \r\r\n505,ALFRED,What if he had? What if she wasn't intending to make a life with you?  \r\r\n506,WAYNE,\"She was, I can't change that -  \"\r\r\n507,ALFRED,\"What if, before she died, she'd written a letter? Explaining that she'd chosen Harvey Dent over you? Wayne watches, confused, as the old man prepares to say -  \"\r\r\n508,ALFRED,\"And what if, to spare you pain...I'd burned that letter? Wayne stares at Alfred, shocked.  \"\r\r\n509,WAYNE,Why would you say such a thing?  \r\r\n510,ALFRED,Because I have to make you understand.  \r\r\n511,WAYNE,You're lying.  \r\r\n512,ALFRED,Because you are as precious to me as you were to your own mother and father and I swore to them that I would protect you and I haven't.  \r\r\n513,WAYNE,You're lying!    \r\r\n514,ALFRED,\"I've never lied to you. Except when I burned Rachel's letter. Wayne turns on the old man, furious.    \"\r\r\n515,WAYNE,How dare you use Rachel to stop me!  \r\r\n516,ALFRED,\"I'm using the truth, Master Wayne. Maybe it's time we all stopped trying to outsmart the truth and just let it have its day. I'm sorry.  68.      \"\r\r\n517,WAYNE,\"Sorry?! You expect to destroy my world, then shake hands?!  \"\r\r\n518,ALFRED,No. I know what this means -  \r\r\n519,WAYNE,\"What does it mean, Alfred?!  \"\r\r\n520,ALFRED,It means your hatred. It means losing the person I've cared for ever since I heard his first cries echo through this house. But it might also mean saving your life. And that is more important.   Wayne looks at Alfred. Furious. Summons the worst thing to say and says it quietly and calmly.  \r\r\n521,WAYNE,\"Goodbye, Alfred.    \"\r\r\n522,ALFRED, \r\r\n523,WAYNE,Alfred? But Alfred is gone.      \r\r\n524,FOX,Answering your own door?  \r\r\n525,WAYNE,Yes. Could you decode the trades on that drive?   Fox hands Wayne a newspaper - the main headline:  BATMAN BACK TO FOIL OR MASTERMIND STOCK RAID...    \r\r\n526,FOX,I didn't need to. Page three. Wayne turns the page:  WAYNE DOUBLES DOWN - AND LOSES...    \r\r\n527,FOX,\"It seems you made a series of large put options on the futures exchange. Verified by thumb print. The options expired at midnight last night. Wayne looks up from the newspaper, reeling.  \"\r\r\n528,FOX,\"Long term we may be able to prove fraud, but for now...you're completely broke. And Wayne Enterprises is about to fall into the hands of John Daggett.  \"\r\r\n529,WAYNE,The weapons - we can't let Daggett get his hands on Applied Sciences -  \r\r\n530,FOX,\"Applied Sciences is shut up tight, and off the books. The energy project is a different story.  \"\r\r\n531,WAYNE,Miranda Tate. We need to convince the board to get behind her. Let's show her the reactor -  \r\r\n532,FOX,We're meeting her there in thirty-five minutes. You better get dressed.  70.    \r\r\n533,MIRANDA,\"You brought me out here to show me a rubbish dump, Mr. Fox?    \"\r\r\n534,FOX,\"Bear with me, Miss Tate. They arrive at a Portakabin and enter.      \"\r\r\n535,FOX,\"Keep your hands and feet inside the car at all times. He hits a button and the floor descends, Miranda is shocked as the office becomes an elevator into -      \"\r\r\n536,MIRANDA,\"This is it, isn't it?    \"\r\r\n537,FOX,The reactor is beneath the river so that it could be instantly flooded in an event of a security breach.    \r\r\n538,MIRANDA,Is Bruce Wayne really that paranoid?  \r\r\n539,FOX,I'm gonna plead the fifth on that one. Miranda marvels as they step off the elevator. She spots a figure deep within: Bruce Wayne.    \r\r\n540,WAYNE,I thought you might like to see what your investment built.  71.    \r\r\n541,MIRANDA,\"No radiation, no fossil fuels. Free, clean energy for an entire city.  \"\r\r\n542,WAYNE,\"If it worked. It doesn't. Wayne leads Miranda to the core. Two perpendicular rings of electromagnets suspend a bowling-ball-sized mass of metal. Wayne hits buttons - the ball glows, then dies to cold.  \"\r\r\n543,WAYNE,\"Ignition, yes. But no chain reaction.    \"\r\r\n544,MIRANDA,You've built a lot of security around a damp squib. Nothing. About three years ago a Russian scientist published a paper on weaponized fusion reactions. One week later your reactor started \r\r\n545,WAYNE,\"Miranda, if it were operational, the danger to Gotham would be too great.    \"\r\r\n546,MIRANDA,Would it make you feel better to know that the Russian scientist died in a plane crash six months ago?    \r\r\n547,WAYNE,Someone else will work out what Dr. Pavel did. Someone else will figure out how to turn this power source into a nuclear weapon. I need you to take control of Wayne Enterprises and this reactor.  \r\r\n548,MIRANDA,And to do what with it?    \r\r\n549,WAYNE,Nothing. Until we can find a way to guarantee its safety.  72.    \r\r\n550,MIRANDA,And if we can't?    \r\r\n551,WAYNE,Decommission it. Flood it.  \r\r\n552,MIRANDA,Destroy the world's best chance for a sustainable future?    \r\r\n553,WAYNE,If the world's not ready. Yes.  \r\r\n554,MIRANDA,\"Bruce, if you want to save the world you have to start trusting it.  \"\r\r\n555,WAYNE,I'm trusting you.    \r\r\n556,MIRANDA,Doesn't count. You have no choice.  \r\r\n557,WAYNE,\"I could've flooded this chamber any time in the last three years. I'm choosing to trust you, Miranda, and that's not the easiest thing for me. Please. His eyes are genuine. Pleading. Miranda nods.    \"\r\r\n558,FOX,We have a board meeting to get to.    \r\r\n559,DAGGETT,\"I'd like to point out that we have a non-board member here. Highly irregular, even if it is his family name above the door... All eyes go to Wayne. An older member of the board pipes up.    \"\r\r\n560,FREDERICKS,Bruce Wayne's family built this  COMPANY -  73.      BOARD MEMBER 2 And he himself has run it -  \r\r\n561,DAGGETT,\"Into the ground, sir. Anybody disagree? Check the value of your shares this morning. Gambling on crazy futures didn't just lose Mr. Wayne his seat, it's lost us all a lot of money. He needs to leave.    \"\r\r\n562,FOX,\"I'm afraid he has a point, Mr. Wayne.  \"\r\r\n563,WAYNE,I understand. Ladies and gentlemen.   Wayne glances at Miranda who nods at him. Wayne leaves.  \r\r\n564,DAGGETT,Let's get down to business.    \r\r\n565,FOX,Right away.    \r\r\n566,REPORTER,\"Wayne, how's it feel to be one of the people?!    \"\r\r\n567,COMPANY VALET,\"I'm sorry, sir, they had paperwork  -   Wayne looks over to see his Lamborghini being towed.  \"\r\r\n568,BLAKE,Looks like you need a lift. Wayne turns to see Blake standing by his patrol car. Nods.  74.      \r\r\n569,DAGGETT,How the hell did Miranda Tate get the inside track on the Wayne board?! Was she meeting with Wayne? Was she sleeping with Wayne?  \r\r\n570,STRYVER,Not that we know of -  \r\r\n571,DAGGETT,\"Clearly you don't 'know of' anything, do you?! Where's Bane?!    \"\r\r\n572,STRYVER,We told him it was urgent -  \r\r\n573,DAGGETT,Then where is the masked -    \r\r\n574,BANE,Speak of the devil... Daggett turns. Bane is already there.  \r\r\n575,BANE,...and he shall appear.  \r\r\n576,DAGGETT,What the hell's going on?  \r\r\n577,BANE,The plan is proceeding as expected.  \r\r\n578,DAGGETT,You see me running Wayne \r\r\n579,BANE, \r\r\n580,DAGGETT,You stay right there! I'm in charge! Bane places a gentle hand on Daggett's shoulder.    \r\r\n581,BANE,Do you feel in charge? Daggett is taken aback. Stryver leaves.    \r\r\n582,DAGGETT,I've paid you a small fortune -  \r\r\n583,BANE,And that gives you power over me?   Daggett considers the heavy hand on his shoulder. Nervous.  \r\r\n584,DAGGETT,What is this?  \r\r\n585,BANE,Your money and infrastructure have been important. Till now.  \r\r\n586,DAGGETT,What are you?    \r\r\n587,BANE,Gotham's reckoning. Come to end the borrowed time you've all been living on...   Bane gently takes the terrified Daggett's head in his hands...  \r\r\n588,DAGGETT,You are true evil...    \r\r\n589,BANE,\"I am necessary evil. Stryver, on the steps outside the living room, flinches.      \"\r\r\n590,BLAKE,When you began...why the mask?    \r\r\n591,WAYNE,To protect the people closest to me.    \r\r\n592,BLAKE,You're a loner with no family.  \r\r\n593,WAYNE,There are always people you care about. You just don't realize how \r\r\n594,BLAKE,It was damn good to see him back.  \r\r\n595,WAYNE,Not everybody agrees.  \r\r\n596,BLAKE,They'll figure it out in the end.  \r\r\n597,WAYNE,Got anything on Bane's whereabouts?  \r\r\n598,BLAKE,\"Yeah, I've got five hundred pages of tunnel records and a flashlight. I could use some help.  \"\r\r\n599,WAYNE,You know what? Drop me in Old Town...  \r\r\n600,WAYNE,Don't wait. I'll get a cab.  \r\r\n601,BLAKE,You got money?  \r\r\n602,WAYNE,\"Actually, no. Blake hands him some bills, watches him cross the street. The radio squawks. Blake reacts - drives off.  \"\r\r\n603,JEN,\"I told you, money first.  \"\r\r\n604,WAYNE,I don't think so.  \r\r\n605,SELINA,He's not a mark. Jen looks at Selina. At Wayne.  \r\r\n606,SELINA,\"And he doesn't have a cent to his name, anyway.  \"\r\r\n607,SELINA,\r\r\n608,WAYNE,\"Actually, they're letting me keep the house.  \"\r\r\n609,SELINA,\" The rich don't even go broke same as the rest of us, huh?  \"\r\r\n610,WAYNE,\r\r\n611,SELINA,Let's just say that I've incurred the wrath of some people less susceptible to my charms than you.  \r\r\n612,WAYNE,My powerful friend hopes to change your mind about leaving.  \r\r\n613,SELINA,And how would he do that?  \r\r\n614,WAYNE,By giving you what you want.  \r\r\n615,SELINA,It doesn't exist.  \r\r\n616,WAYNE,He says it does. He wants to meet. Tonight.  \r\r\n617,SELINA,Why?    \r\r\n618,WAYNE,He needs to find Bane. He thinks you'd know how.  \r\r\n619,SELINA,\"Tell him I'll think about it. Wayne nods, starts to leave.  \"\r\r\n620,SELINA,Mr. Wayne? I'm sorry they took all your money.  \r\r\n621,WAYNE,\"No, you're not.      \"\r\r\n622,FOLEY,\"Can we help you, officer?  \"\r\r\n623,BLAKE,John Daggett's body was found in a dumpster an hour ago. I thought you might like to know.    \r\r\n624,GORDON,Why?  \r\r\n625,BLAKE,Because Daggett's name is all over the permits I pulled to map the tunnels under Gotham. Blake hands Gordon a stack of files. Foley glares at Blake.    \r\r\n626,BLAKE,\"MTA maintenance, sewer construction...  \"\r\r\n627,GORDON, \r\r\n628,FOLEY, \r\r\n629,GORDON,\"Get more men, work a grid. I want him found.  \"\r\r\n630,FOLEY,\"Yeah, yeah - the masked man. We're on it.   Gordon eyes the files hungrily - glances up at Blake.  \"\r\r\n631,GORDON,This is good work. Lose the uniform - you're working for me now. We could use some hotter heads around here.  80.      \r\r\n632,BLAKE,This could just be a coincidence.  \r\r\n633,GORDON,\"You're a detective now, son, you're not allowed to believe in coincidence anymore. Blake tries to conceal his excitement from Foley.      \"\r\r\n634,WAYNE,No. I'm on my own now.    \r\r\n635,MIRANDA,Do you have keys? Wayne looks a little helpless all of a sudden.    \r\r\n636,WAYNE,Never needed them... She takes his hand.  \r\r\n637,MIRANDA,Let's find a window.    \r\r\n638,MIRANDA,\"Fox worked the board like you've never seen - I'm in, Daggett's out and he's not happy. Wayne sets down the newspaper:  \"\r\r\n639,FROM BILLIONAIRE TO BUM, 81.      \r\r\n640,WAYNE,Hope you don't like me for your money. Miranda kicks off her shoes. Glances at the paper.    \r\r\n641,MIRANDA,Suffering builds character. Then at a photo of Wayne's parents.    \r\r\n642,MIRANDA,\"I'll take care of your parents' legacy, Bruce. Miranda picks up a photo of Rachel.    \"\r\r\n643,MIRANDA,Who's this? Wayne looks at her. Can't find words...  \r\r\n644,MIRANDA,Where's Alfred?  \r\r\n645,WAYNE,He left. Taking everything. Miranda puts the photo down. Kisses him. Passionately. Then again. He kisses back. Suddenly the lights go out.  \r\r\n646,MIRANDA,What's that?    \r\r\n647,WAYNE, \r\r\n648,WAYNE,You're pretty good at that.    \r\r\n649,MIRANDA,\"When I was a child we had almost nothing. But on the nights we had a fire, we felt very rich indeed. She returns to him, pulling a blanket around both of them.  82.    \"\r\r\n650,WAYNE,I assumed your family was wealthy.  \r\r\n651,MIRANDA,Not always. Not when I was young.   He traces a scar on her shoulder.  \r\r\n652,MIRANDA,An old mistake.    \r\r\n653,WAYNE,\"I've made a few myself. She turns to him, tracing the scars across his chest.  \"\r\r\n654,MIRANDA,\r\r\n655,WAYNE,\"Someday perhaps. Not tonight. She pulls him close. He kisses her. They fold into each other, the warm heart at the center of a vast, cold room.      \"\r\r\n656,CATWOMAN,Don't be shy.   ...Batman is there.  83.      \r\r\n657,CATWOMAN,Wayne says you can get me the 'Clean Slate'.  \r\r\n658,BATMAN,That depends.  \r\r\n659,CATWOMAN,On what?  \r\r\n660,BATMAN,On what you want it for. I acquired it to keep it out of the wrong hands.  \r\r\n661,CATWOMAN,\"Still don't trust me, huh? How can we change that?  \"\r\r\n662,BATMAN,Start by taking me to Bane.  \r\r\n663,CATWOMAN, \r\r\n664,CATWOMAN,\"From here, Bane's men patrol the tunnels...and they are not your average brawlers.  \"\r\r\n665,BATMAN,Neither am I. Catwoman swings into a -    \r\r\n666,CATWOMAN,He's behind you.  84.      \r\r\n667,MERCENARY, \r\r\n668,BATMAN,\"Me. Darkness smashes onto the Mercenary. Gunfire in the tunnel. Catwoman races along, pursued by a Mercenary. He is yanked off his feet by darkness - he screams... Batman picks off more and more Mercenaries. Screams echo... Batman follows Catwoman through the dark tunnel.  \"\r\r\n669,CATWOMAN,\"Just a little further. A grate slams down, separating them - the lights come on. He is deep inside.      \"\r\r\n670,CATWOMAN,I had to find a way to stop them trying to kill me.  \r\r\n671,BATMAN,You've made a serious mistake.  \r\r\n672,BANE,\"Not as serious as yours, I fear. Batman turns. Bane emerges from behind the waterfalls.  \"\r\r\n673,BATMAN,Bane.  \r\r\n674,BANE,\"Let's not stand on ceremony here, Mr. Wayne.   Catwoman hears the name. Less sure of what she's done. Batman moves at Bane - strikes powerful blows - Bane catches his fist.  \"\r\r\n675,BANE,\"Peace has cost you strength. Victory has defeated you.  85.     Bane SMASHES Batman back - kicks him off the catwalk - Batman drops, uses his cape to land. Bane climbs down on a chain - his men watch in disciplined silence - Batman hurls flashbangs at Bane, who doesn't flinch.    \"\r\r\n676,BANE,Theatricality and deception are powerful agents...to the uninitiated. Batman lashes out at Bane - Bane counters - they separate.    \r\r\n677,BANE,\"But we are initiated, aren't we, Bruce? The League of Shadows. And you betrayed us...    \"\r\r\n678,BATMAN,Us? You were excommunicated. From a gang of psychopaths.  \r\r\n679,BANE,\"Now I am the League of Shadows, here to fulfill R¯'s al Gh¯l's  \"\r\r\n680,A U,\"destiny... Batman hurls himself at Bane, throwing him into the waterfall, where he smashes his fists and gauntlets into Bane's mask again and again, water cascading over them.   Bane is not moving. Just taking the blows. Batman pauses. Bane's arms SHOOT OUT, SMASHING Batman aside - Bane RISES...  \"\r\r\n681,BANE,You fight like a younger man. Nothing held back. No reserves. Admirable. But mistaken. Batman hits a switch on his belt - the lights go out - Bane turns slowly addressing all the shadows at once.    \r\r\n682,BANE,\"You think darkness is your ally. But you merely adopted the dark. I was born in it. Formed by it...   In the shadows, Batman circles, looking to strike...  \"\r\r\n683,BANE,I didn't see the light until I was already a man. And by then it was nothing to me but blinding...  86.     Bane lunges backwards into the darkness - Batman's throat in his grasp.  \r\r\n684,BANE,\"The shadows betray you, because they belong to me...   Bane SMASHES him into the ground, POUNDING, pounding, pounding the hard cowl with his bare fists until it CRACKS. Bane RISES from Batman, gestures to the ceiling of the chamber - explosive charges have been drilled into holes...  \"\r\r\n685,BANE,I will show you where I've made my home while preparing to bring justice. Then...I will break you.   A Mercenary tosses Bane a detonator - Batman watches through cracked cowl - Bane hits the detonator - explosions BURST over his head as the ceiling CRUMBLES revealing: Applied Sciences - Bane has dropped the bottom out of Fox's weapons store...a camouflage Tumbler rests in the rubble.  \r\r\n686,BATMAN,No...  \r\r\n687,BANE,Your precious armory. Gratefully accepted. We will need it.    \r\r\n688,BANE,\"I wondered which would break first - your spirit...   Batman SWINGS at him - misses - Bane GRABS him, lifts him  HIGH. ...or your body. Bane brings Batman down onto his knee, BREAKING his back with a horrific CRACK.  87.     In the shadows, Catwoman looks on. Shocked. Bane crouches to pull the broken cowl off the broken Wayne. Mercenaries lift Wayne's body and carry him off... Bane stares into the hollow eyes of his trophy...   Catwoman slinks back into the shadows, and we -  FADE TO BLACK.  FADE IN:      \"\r\r\n689,BLAKE, \r\r\n690,UNIFORM,\"Excuse me, Miss. I need to see your ticket and identification, please.   Selina, surprised, fumbles with her purse.  \"\r\r\n691,SELINA,\"Would you mind?  88.     She hands the Uniform her hat - punches him through the brim, stuffs him in a closet - plants her mangled hat on his head.      \"\r\r\n692,BLAKE,I showed your picture to the Congressman and guess what?  \r\r\n693,SELINA,\"Don't tell me, still in love?  \"\r\r\n694,BLAKE,\"Head over heels. Pressing charges, though. Blake lays a police file down with a thump. You've made some mistakes, Ms. Kyle.    \"\r\r\n695,SELINA,Girl's gonna eat.  \r\r\n696,BLAKE,You have an appetite. Why run? You can't hide from us with this record.  \r\r\n697,SELINA,Maybe it's not you I'm running from.  \r\r\n698,BLAKE,Who then? Bane? What do you know about him?    \r\r\n699,SELINA, \r\r\n700,BLAKE,\"We can offer you protection... Selina looks at him with contempt. Blake shrugs, switches off the tape, moves to the door.    \"\r\r\n701,BLAKE,\"When I spotted you, I was looking for a friend...Bruce Wayne. Selina turns to look at Blake. His eyes plead with her.    \"\r\r\n702,BLAKE,Did they kill him?  \r\r\n703,SELINA,\"I'm not sure.   And we -  CUT TO: BLACK SCREEN. Sounds: screaming, laughing, CRYING. Sights: LIGHT, bodies FALLING, a DARK SKULL... And we are -    \"\r\r\n704,WAYNE,Why didn't you just kill me?    \r\r\n705,BANE,You don't fear death. You welcome it. Your punishment is to be more severe.    \r\r\n706,WAYNE, \r\r\n707,BANE,Yes. But not of your body. Of your soul. Wayne exhales. Eyes losing focus from sheer pain.  90.      \r\r\n708,WAYNE,Where am I?  \r\r\n709,BANE,\"Home.   Wayne's eyes dart about: filthy stone walls, distant sunlight from above, iron bars: an underground prison. Where I learned the truth about \"\r\r\n710,A,Gh¯l's destiny. We will destroy  \r\r\n711,U,Gotham. And when it is done...when Gotham is ashes...then you have my permission to die. Bane rises. Leaves. Wayne drifts back to unconsciousness.      \r\r\n712,GUARD,We're locking her up in here?  \r\r\n713,WARDEN,The Dent Act allows non-segregation based on extraordinary need. First time she broke out of women's correctional she was sixteen. Selina passes a Huge Inmate who strains through the bars...    \r\r\n714,HUGE INMATE,\"Little closer, baby...  \"\r\r\n715,SELINA,\"Why, honey, you wanna hold my hand?   Without breaking step, she slips his outstretched hands between her handcuffed ones and cartwheels, snapping his arms - he screams in agony - she keeps walking...  \"\r\r\n716,WARDEN,She'll be just fine.      \r\r\n717,FOX,I don't see the need for a board meeting on the energy project -  \r\r\n718,MIRANDA,Bruce got a lot of things right. Keeping the board in the dark wasn't one of them... Fox swings the doors to the boardroom open...      \r\r\n719,BANE,This meeting is called to order. Fox and Miranda freeze. Staring at the mask.  92.      \r\r\n720,BANE,\"Chair and President. I also need one ordinary member - Mr. Fox, would you care to nominate?    \"\r\r\n721,FREDERICKS,No. I volunteer. The dignified older board member gets to his feet. Mercernaries round the three up.    \r\r\n722,FOX,Where are you taking us?  \r\r\n723,BANE,Where you buried your resources. The bowels of Gotham.      \r\r\n724,GORDON,So you think our friend is gone again?  \r\r\n725,BLAKE, \r\r\n726,FOLEY,\"Okay, Commissioner, you were right.  \"\r\r\n727,GORDON,What's happened?    \r\r\n728,FOLEY,\"Your masked man kidnapped the Wayne Enterprises board. He let most of them go, but took three down into the sewers.    \"\r\r\n729,GORDON,\"No more patrols, no more hide and seek. Send every available cop down there to smoke him out.  93.      \"\r\r\n730,FOLEY,The Mayor won't want panic -  \r\r\n731,BLAKE,So it's a training exercise.   Foley looks at Gordon.  \r\r\n732,FOLEY,I'm sorry for not taking you  SERIOUSLY -    \r\r\n733,GORDON,Don't apologize for believing the world's in better shape then it is...just fight to make it true.   Foley nods. Leaves. Blake gets up.  \r\r\n734,GORDON,\"Not you. You're telling me the Batman's gone. So you chase up the Daggett leads, any way you can.   Blake nods.    \"\r\r\n735,PRISONER,He asks if you would pay us to let you die. I told him you have nothing.  \r\r\n736,WAYNE,Do it for the pleasure.   The Prisoner puts bread to Wayne's lips.  \r\r\n737,PRISONER,\"They pay me more than that to keep you alive.   A chant gets Wayne's attention. He rolls his head painfully to watch a Tattooed Prisoner hand a thick rope to a Strong Man, who ties it around his chest, watched by other Prisoners.  94.      \"\r\r\n738,PRISONER,\"He will try the climb. Strong Man starts scaling the wall. The Prisoners' chant grows stronger as he climbs towards the light.   Above: Strong Man stops, perched on a ledge, a twelve-foot leap from the rest of the climb... The chanting peaks as Strong Man leaps...misses...falls. The rope catches - he swings into the rock face. Prisoners fall silent as Strong Man is lowered, broken, bloody, to the prison floor.    \"\r\r\n739,WAYNE,Has anyone made it?  \r\r\n740,PRISONER,Of course not.   The Blind Prisoner barks at him.  \r\r\n741,WAYNE,What does he say?    \r\r\n742,PRISONER,He says there is one who did. A child... \r\r\n743,PRISONER,A child who had been born in this hell...  \r\r\n744,WAYNE,Bane.    \r\r\n745,PRISONER,An old legend. Nothing more. The Prisoner leaves Wayne's cell - switches on the TV.    \r\r\n746,WAYNE,Don't.  \r\r\n747,PRISONER,Whatever they want you to see...it's happening soon.  95.      \r\r\n748,BANE,Turn it on.   Fox shakes his head. Bane holds his gun to Fredericks' head.  \r\r\n749,BANE,I only need one other board member. There are eight more waiting upstairs.    \r\r\n750,FOX,I won't do it. Fredericks trembles. Bane cocks the weapon.    \r\r\n751,MIRANDA,\"Alright, stop. She walks up to the scanner. Places her hand on it. It beeps. She turns to Fox. Quietly pleading.  96.    \"\r\r\n752,MIRANDA,\"Lucius, you'll kill this man and yourself, and barely slow them down. Fox reluctantly puts his hand on the scanner. Then Fredericks. The core glows brighter and brighter. Dr. Pavel is transfixed.    \"\r\r\n753,BANE,\"Do your work. Bane turns to his men. Gestures at the hostages. Take them to the surface. People of their status deserve to see the next era of western civilization. Fox, Miranda and Fredericks are led back into the rubble.    \"\r\r\n754,REPORTER,We're seeing literally thousands of police heading into the sewers -  \r\r\n755,MAYOR,\"A training exercise, that's all. If you'll excuse me, I've got tickets to watch our boys thrash Rapid City. The Mayor heads into the stadium with the crowds...      \"\r\r\n756,BLAKE,\"I've been to half Daggett's cement plants, logged locations they've poured for underground construction...  97.      \"\r\r\n757,GORDON,Anything strange about the pourings? Blake glances at a large map - dots mark pouring locations.    \r\r\n758,BLAKE,\"Honestly, Commissioner, I don't know anything about civil engineering.    \"\r\r\n759,GORDON,But you know about patterns. Keep looking. Blake pulls up in front of a cement plant.      \r\r\n760,BANE,\r\r\n761,BANE,\"Five, by my calculations.    DR. PAVEL And then it will go off.  \"\r\r\n762,BANE,\"For the sake of your family, Dr. Pavel, I hope so.   Dr. Pavel stares as Mercenaries start to disconnect the core...  98.    \"\r\r\n763,WORKER,Boss is about to leave. Blake walks past cement mixers. Spots someone. A Driver.    \r\r\n764,BLAKE,Hey. The Driver turns.  \r\r\n765,BLAKE,\"That was you outside the stock exchange, right?  \"\r\r\n766,DRIVER,When?    \r\r\n767,BLAKE,When? When half the city's cops were trying to pull onto Castle Street and your truck shut them out.    \r\r\n768,DRIVER,Oh yeah. You're that cop -  \r\r\n769,BLAKE,\"Detective, now.   Behind Blake the Worker puts his hand is his pocket...  \"\r\r\n770,BLAKE,\"And as a detective...I'm not allowed to believe in coincidences  ANYMORE - Blake spins, drawing his weapon. The Worker lunges with a knife, Blake smashes his hand to one side and shoots him. The Driver grabs him from behind. Blake wrestles, but the Driver is strong, trained. Blake can't aim his gun, he fires behind, into a steel mixer - the bullets ricochet, one catches the Driver in the back and he goes down... Blake, gasping, kneels beside the Driver.  \"\r\r\n771,BLAKE,What were you doing?! What?!   The man dies. Blake looks down at his gun. Disgusted. Tosses is down. Pulls out his phone. Dials.  99.      \r\r\n772,BLAKE,\"Commissioner, I'm at the Fourteenth Street plant with two dead witnesses and a lot of questions. Call me -   Blake freezes, stooped to pick up his gun. Looking at some empty barrels... Commissioner, they've got \"\r\r\n773,BLAKE,\"Oh, God.   Blake fires up the cruiser and pulls out, hard.    \"\r\r\n774,BLAKE,Patch me into Foley!  \r\r\n775,DISPATCH, \r\r\n776,BLAKE,They're heading into a trap!      \r\r\n777,FOLEY,Foley.  \r\r\n778,BLAKE,It's a trap! Pull everyone out! Bane's been pouring concrete laced with explosives -  100.      \r\r\n779,FOLEY,Where?  \r\r\n780,BLAKE,There's a ring around the tunnels - they're gonna blow it and trap the cops underground! Foley looks up with dread at the mouth of the tunnel.  \r\r\n781,FOLEY,Pull out! Pull 'em out!    \r\r\n782,BANE,Let the games begin. The Mercenaries hit the detonators.      \r\r\n783,BANE,\"Gotham, take control of your city...      \"\r\r\n784,BLAKE,Foley?  \r\r\n785,FOLEY, \r\r\n786,BLAKE, \r\r\n787,GORDON,\"Clear the corners, rookie. Blake turns. Gordon holds his service weapon. The Mercenaries are on the ground, dead.  \"\r\r\n788,GORDON,\"Get my coat, son.  103.      \"\r\r\n789,BANE,This is the instrument of your liberation...    \r\r\n790,ANALYST,Satellite shows a radiation spike...    ANALYST 2 Whatever it is...it's nuclear.    \r\r\n791,BANE,\"Identify yourself to the world.  DR. PAVEL Dr. Leonid Pavel, nuclear physicist. Bane turns Dr. Pavel's head for the cameras.      \"\r\r\n792,CIA ANALYST,\"Pavel was confirmed dead - plane crash on an Agency pull-out of Uzbekistan... But it certainly looks like him - He points to a monitor with a photo of Dr. Pavel. An Air Force General rubs his chin, thinking, nervous.  104.      \"\r\r\n793,BANE,Tell the world what this is.    DR. PAVEL A fully primed neutron bomb. With a blast radius of six miles.  \r\r\n794,BANE,And who can disarm this device?  DR. PAVEL Only me.  \r\r\n795,BANE,\"Thank you, Doctor. Bane snaps Dr. Pavel's neck in front of the world.  \"\r\r\n796,BANE,\"The bomb is armed, the bomb is mobile, the identity of the triggerman is a mystery. One of you holds the detonator - we come not as conquerors, but as liberators to return control of this city to the people. At the first sign of interference from the outside world or of people attempting to flee, this anonymous Gothamite, this unsung hero, will trigger the bomb. For now, martial law is in effect. Return to your homes, hold your families close, and wait. Tomorrow you claim what is rightfully yours. Bane turns, leaves the field, followed by his men.      \"\r\r\n797,GENERAL,\"Pull back the fighters, start high-level reconnaissance flights. And get the President on the line.      \"\r\r\n798,LEAD MERCENARY,\"Tanks and planes cannot stop us detonating our device. Send an emissary to discuss terms of access for supplies and communication.   A Captain steps forward, walks to the apex of the bridge.  \"\r\r\n799,CAPTAIN,\"How many of you are there, son? \"\r\r\n800,LEAD MERCENARY,We don't. But you do.    \r\r\n801,CAPTAIN,Why in the hell would we help you keep your hostages?  \r\r\n802,LEAD MERCENARY,If people start crossing this bridge Gotham gets blown to hell. The Captain considers this. Troubled.      \r\r\n803,PRESIDENT, \r\r\n804,PRESIDENT, \r\r\n805,PRESIDENT, \r\r\n806,BLAKE,What does that mean?  \r\r\n807,GORDON,It means we're on our own. I have to get in front of a camera -  \r\r\n808,BLAKE,\"Sir, they'll kill you the second you show your face -    \"\r\r\n809,GORDON,The Mayor's dead. I'm the symbol of law and order. Bane says he's giving Gotham back to the people - they need to know that I could lead.  \r\r\n810,BLAKE,Bane's not gonna let that happen -    \r\r\n811,GORDON,Then he'll show his true colors.  \r\r\n812,BLAKE,And you'll be dead.   Gordon says nothing.  107.      \r\r\n813,BANE,Behind you stands a symbol of oppression. Blackgate Prison...    \r\r\n814,BANE,Where a thousand men have languished for years. Under the Dent Act. Under the name of this  MAN -    \r\r\n815,BANE,\"Harvey Dent. Held up to you, and over you, as a shining example of justice and good...      \"\r\r\n816,BLAKE,\"We're gonna keep moving you, till we can get you in front of a camera  -      \"\r\r\n817,BANE,But they supplied you a false idol. A straw man. To placate. To stop you tearing down this corrupt city...      \r\r\n818,BANE,...and rebuilding it the way it should have been rebuilt generations ago...      \r\r\n819,BANE,\"Let me tell you the truth about Harvey Dent. In the words of Gotham's Police Commissioner, James Gordon...    \"\r\r\n820,BANE,\"'The truth about Harvey Dent is simple in only one regard - it has been hidden for too long. After his devastating injuries, Harvey's mind has recovered no better than his mutilated face. He was a broken, dangerous man, not the crusader for justice that I, James Gordon, have portrayed him to be for the last eight years. Harvey's rage was indiscriminate. Psychopathic. He held my family at gunpoint, then fell to his death in the struggle over my son's life. The Batman did not murder Harvey Dent - he saved  \"\r\r\n821,BANE,'I praised the madman who tried to murder my own child.'      \r\r\n822,BANE,\"'The things we did in Harvey's name brought desperately needed security to our streets... But I can no longer live with my lie. It is time to trust the people of Gotham with the truth, and it is time for me to resign.'   Bane folds the papers. Looks out to the stunned crowd. Do you accept this man's resignation?   Individuals in the crows start shouting 'Yes!'    \"\r\r\n823,BANE,Do you accept the resignation of all the liars?! All the corrupt?! More and more of the crowd is chanting 'Yes!'    \r\r\n824,BLAKE,\"These men, locked up in Blackgate for eight years, denied parole under the Dent Act. Based on a lie.  \"\r\r\n825,GORDON,\"A lie to keep a city from burning to the ground. Gotham needed a hero, someone to believe in -  \"\r\r\n826,BLAKE,Not as much as it does now. But you betrayed everything you stood for.    \r\r\n827,GORDON,\r\r\n828,BLAKE,\"Your hands look pretty filthy to me, Commissioner.   Gordon stares at him. Blake goes back to packing.    \"\r\r\n829,BANE,\"We take Gotham from the corrupt. The rich. The oppressors of generations who've kept you down with the myth of opportunity. And we give it to you, the people. Gotham is yours - none shall interfere. Do as you please...   The Tumbler fires, blowing the doors to hell.   \"\r\r\n830,BANE,\"But start by storming Blackgate and freeing the oppressed... Step forward, those who would serve...   Bane's men surge through the burning gates...    \"\r\r\n831,BANE,For an army will be raised... Mercenaries hand out weapons to escaping Prisoners...      \r\r\n832,BANE,The powerful will be ripped from their decadent nests...      \r\r\n833,BANE,...and cast into the cold world the rest of us have known and endured...    \r\r\n834,BANE,Courts will be convened...      \r\r\n835,BANE,The spoils will be enjoyed...    \r\r\n836,BANE,Blood will be shed...   \r\r\n837,BANE,\"But the police will live, until they are ready to serve true justice...      \"\r\r\n838,BANE,This great city will endure... Close enough to see the flickering digits of its countdown...  \r\r\n839,BANE,Gotham will survive. Mercenaries load the core into the back of a black truck.    \r\r\n840,PRISONER,\"He says you must first straighten your back. The Prisoner helps Wayne roll over, painfully.    \"\r\r\n841,WAYNE,How would he know?  \r\r\n842,PRISONER,He was the prison doctor. A morphine addict who incurred the displeasure of powerful people. Including your masked friend.  \r\r\n843,WAYNE,How?  \r\r\n844,PRISONER,\"Many years ago, during a time of plague, Bane was attacked by other prisoners. The doctor's fumbling attempts to repair the damage left him in perpetual agony. The mask holds his pain at bay.  \"\r\r\n845,WAYNE,Is Bane the child you spoke of? Was he born here?    \r\r\n846,PRISONER,The legend is that there was a mercenary working for the local warlord who fell in love with his daughter. They married in secret.   The Prisoner takes a rope - ties it under Wayne's arms.  \r\r\n847,PRISONER,\"When the warlord found out, he condemned the mercenary to this pit. But then exiled him instead. \"\r\r\n848,PRISONER,\"The mercenary understood that the warlord's daughter had secured his release, but he couldn't know the true price of his freedom. She had taken his place in the pit.   \"\r\r\n849,PRISONER,And she was with the child. The mercenary's child.   \r\r\n850,PRISONER,One day the doctor forgot the lock the cell... \r\r\n851,PRISONER,Innocence cannot flower underground. It was to be stamped out. But the child had a friend. A protector...   \r\r\n852,PRISONER,...who showed the others that this innocence was their redemption. The mother was not so lucky. The Blind Prisoner shouts at the Prisoner. He nods.    \r\r\n853,PRISONER,This is Bane's prison now. Bane would not want this story told. The Prisoner pulls - Wayne screams in pain as he is pulled upright. The Prisoner ties him off. Checks his spine. You have a protruding vertebra...I'm going to force it back...  \r\r\n854,WAYNE,\"How -?   The Prisoner punches Wayne in the back, hard. Wayne screams.  \"\r\r\n855,PRISONER,\"You stay like this. Until you stand.   Wayne passes out from the pain and we FADE TO BLACK. Wayne is hanging in his cell, delirious.   \"\r\r\n856,R¯'S AL GH¯L, \r\r\n857,A U,\"Did you not think I'd return, Bruce? R¯'s al Gh¯l, in his Ducard guise, steps in front of Wayne.  \"\r\r\n858,A U,   \r\r\n859,R¯'S AL GH¯L, \r\r\n860,A U,I told you I was immortal.  \r\r\n861,WAYNE,I watched you die.    \r\r\n862,R¯'S AL GH¯L, \r\r\n863,A U,\"There are many forms of immortality. Wayne looks inward, remembering...   \"\r\r\n864,A, \r\r\n865,R¯'S AL GH¯L, \r\r\n866,A U,Once I had a wife. My great love. She was taken from me...   \r\r\n867,A, \r\r\n868,WAYNE,You were the mercenary. Bane is your child. Your heir. \r\r\n869,A, \r\r\n870,R¯'S AL GH¯L, \r\r\n871,A U,An heir to ensure the League of Shadows fulfills its duty to restore balance to civilization.  \r\r\n872,WAYNE,No...  \r\r\n873,R¯'S AL GH¯L, \r\r\n874,A U,\"You yourself fought the decadence of Gotham for years. With all your strength and resources, all your moral authority. And the only victory you could achieve was a lie. Finally you understand... Gotham is beyond saving...  \"\r\r\n875,WAYNE, NO!  \r\r\n876,R¯'S AL GH¯L, \r\r\n877,A U,And must be allowed to die. CUT TO WHITE. And we are -      \r\r\n878,BLAKE,For the bus in case there's a chance to evacuate. Keep it in here - people are siphoning parked cars.    \r\r\n879,FATHER REILLY,Really?  \r\r\n880,BLAKE, \r\r\n881,FATHER REILLY,Right. Any news? Is the  COMMISSIONER -    \r\r\n882,BLAKE,\"Less you know, Father. How're the boys?    \"\r\r\n883,FATHER REILLY,\"Power's been on more, so they get some TV.   Blake smiles. Moves to the door. Blake, you be careful out there. They're hunting down cops like dogs.   Blake nods. Leaves.    \"\r\r\n884,JEN,Who's that?    \r\r\n885,SELINA,This was someone's home.  \r\r\n886,JEN,Now it's everyone's home.   Selina stares out at a Tumbler rolling by.  \r\r\n887,JEN,\"'Storm's coming', remember? This is what you wanted.    \"\r\r\n888,SELINA,No. It's what I thought I wanted.    \r\r\n889,PRISONER,Why build yourself?    \r\r\n890,WAYNE,I'm not meant to die in here. The Prisoner indicates the TV:    SIEGE OF GOTHAM: DAY 84.  \r\r\n891,PRISONER,Here? There? What's the difference? Wayne ignores this. Focuses on his body...      \r\r\n892,PRISONER,I told you it could not be done.  \r\r\n893,WAYNE,You told me a child did it...    \r\r\n894,PRISONER,No ordinary child... \r\r\n895,FOLEY,You have ID?  SPECIAL FORCES 1 Of course not.    \r\r\n896,FOLEY,How can we trust you?  \r\r\n897,GORDON,\"We don't have any choice.   Gordon and Blake emerge from the back of the room.  SPECIAL FORCES 1 Commissioner Gordon? Captain Jones, Special Forces.    \"\r\r\n898,GORDON,\"Captain, glad to have you here.    \"\r\r\n899,CAPTAIN JONES,How many of you are there?  \r\r\n900,GORDON,Dozens. I'd rather not say exactly. But the men trapped underground number almost three thousand.  \r\r\n901,CAPTAIN JONES,What kind of shape they're in?    \r\r\n902,GORDON,\"They've been getting water, food.  \"\r\r\n903,CAPTAIN JONES,Could we break them out?    \r\r\n904,BLAKE,\"Yes, sir - take out the mercenaries guarding the outflow south of Ackerman Park, blow the rubble, you've got a hole big enough for ten at a time. I'm in contact with my partner - they're waiting for the day.  SPECIAL FORCES 2 Men who haven't seen daylight for three months?    \"\r\r\n905,BLAKE,Men with automatic weapons who haven't seen daylight in three months.    \r\r\n906,CAPTAIN JONES,What about the bomb? The satellites can't see any radiation hot spots...      \r\r\n907,GORDON,They keep it on a truck - it must have a lead-lined roof. They move it constantly.  \r\r\n908,CAPTAIN JONES,But you know the truck?    \r\r\n909,GORDON,\"They've got three of them. The routes don't vary much. Two Tumblers lead a massive black truck down the street. Captain Jones reaches into his jacket and triggers a Geiger counter. Shows Blake the display. Nods. One of the Tumblers stops, turns back. Blake leads them down a side street.    \"\r\r\n910,CAPTAIN JONES,What about the triggerman?  \r\r\n911,GORDON,No leads. It's a bluff - Bane wouldn't give control of that bomb to someone else.  \r\r\n912,CAPTAIN JONES,\"We can't take that chance. Until we have the triggerman, we just track the device, smuggle men over -  \"\r\r\n913,BLAKE,\"While Gotham lives under a warlord, like in some failed state?    \"\r\r\n914,CAPTAIN JONES,\"Dial it back, officer. This situation is unprecedented. We can't do anything to risk millions of lives.    \"\r\r\n915,BLAKE, \r\r\n916,GORDON,\"Captain, things are more complicated than you think. There's somebody you need to meet. Blake? Blake nods, leads Jones and his men up the stairs.      \"\r\r\n917,BLAKE,I was up here looking for a vantage point. Found the people who run the corporation who owns it living here.  \r\r\n918,CAPTAIN JONES,Which corporation?  \r\r\n919,FOX,\"Wayne Enterprises. Lucius Fox is there, with Miranda Tate.    \"\r\r\n920,BLAKE,\"Captain, meet Mr. Fox. Mr. Fox, I'd like you to brief the Captain. Captain Jones indicates Miranda.    \"\r\r\n921,FOX,Miss Tate is fully aware of the situation.  \r\r\n922,MIRANDA,\"And as CEO of Wayne Enterprises, I have to take responsibility for it.  \"\r\r\n923,CAPTAIN JONES,Why?    \r\r\n924,MIRANDA,\"Because, Captain, we built it.  \"\r\r\n925,CAPTAIN JONES,You built the bomb?    \r\r\n926,FOX,\"It was built as a fusion reactor. The first of its kind. Bane turned the core into a bomb, then disconnected it from the reactor.     \"\r\r\n927,BLAKE,And here's the important part.  \r\r\n928,FOX,\"As the device's fuel cells decay, it's becoming increasingly unstable...until the point of detonation.  \"\r\r\n929,BLAKE,The bomb's a time bomb.    \r\r\n930,FOX,And it will go off. In twenty-three days. Captain Jones reels at this news.    \r\r\n931,BLAKE,Bane's revolution is a sham. He's watching Gotham rearrange its deckchairs while the whole ship's going down. Your appeasement plan might not be as practical as you thought. Captain Jones throws Blake a look. Addresses Fox.  \r\r\n932,CAPTAIN JONES,Could you disarm it?  \r\r\n933,FOX,\"I don't know, But I could reconnect it to the reactor. Stabilize it.    \"\r\r\n934,CAPTAIN JONES,We'd have to let the Pentagon know.  SPECIAL FORCES 2 They'll be monitoring our  FREQUENCIES -  \r\r\n935,CAPTAIN JONES,\"We have no choice. Let's move away from this location, then call it in.      \"\r\r\n936,BLAKE,\"Fox, somebody sold us out! Fox and Miranda burst into the corridor.    \"\r\r\n937,FOX,\"Take Miranda - Blake grabs Miranda, heads for the back stairs. Mercenaries jump out of the elevator, firing high.    \"\r\r\n938,MERCERNARY, DOWN ON THE FLOOR! Fox freezes. Lowers himself to the ground.      \r\r\n939,CAPTAIN JONES,I'll die before I talk...  \r\r\n940,BANE,\"I'm on your schedule, Captain.   Bane places his hand over Jones's nose and mouth.  \"\r\r\n941,MERCERNARY,\"There were people living upstairs.   Bane looks up, disinterested. Jones is dead.  \"\r\r\n942,BANE,Give them over for judgement. \r\r\n943,PRISONER,He says the leap to freedom is not about strength.    \r\r\n944,WAYNE,My body makes the jump.  \r\r\n945,BLIND PRISONER, \r\r\n946,WAYNE,My soul's as ready to escape as my body.    \r\r\n947,BLIND PRISONER,Fear is why you fail.  \r\r\n948,WAYNE,I'm not afraid. I'm angry.   Wayne throws punches...focused.    \r\r\n949,SKINNY PRISONER,\"Shouldn't you get him down? The Prisoner glances up at Wayne, disdainful.    \"\r\r\n950,PRISONER,He'll keep. As Wayne drifts into unconsciousness we - \r\r\n951,THOMAS WAYNE,And why do we fall?      \r\r\n952,BLIND PRISONER, \r\r\n953,WAYNE,Why?  \r\r\n954,BLIND PRISONER,How can you move faster then possible? Fight longer than possible? If not from the most powerful impulse of the spirit. The fear of death. The will to survive. Wayne gets up onto his elbow. Looks at the Blind Prisoner.  \r\r\n955,WAYNE,I do fear death. I fear dying in here while my city burns with no one there to save it.  \r\r\n956,BLIND PRISONER,Then make the climb.  \r\r\n957,WAYNE,How?  \r\r\n958,BLIND PRISONER,As the child did. Without the rope. \r\r\n959,PRISONER,\"Supplies for your journey? Prisoners nearby laugh. Wayne moves to the cliff face. The Prisoner follows, intrigued by Wayne's new demeanor. The Tattooed Prisoner offers him the rope. Wayne refuses. Starts to climb. Prisoners gather around as word spreads. Wayne makes his way cautiously up the treacherous rock face. Down below the Prisoners start a low chant. As Wayne hoists himself up onto the precipice something EXPLODES from the cliff face. Wayne flinches - BATS... They circle up to the opening above... Wayne closes his eyes. The chant RISES. Wayne takes a breath...opens his eyes...looks down at the drop...up again...then he jumps.   Time skips a beat as the Prisoners stop breathing. And Wayne GRABS the ledge above. The Prisoners go WILD as Wayne hoists himself up onto the ledge. The Blind Prisoner nods. Wayne climbs to FREEDOM.      \"\r\r\n960,STRYVER,I want to see Bane! There's been a mistake! Take me to Bane! Fox watches him dragged upstairs...   \r\r\n961,STRYVER,\"There's been a mistake! Where's Bane?!  VOICE There's been no mistake, Mr. Stryver.   Stryver turns to look at the 'judge': Dr. Jonathan Crane.  \"\r\r\n962,CRANE,\"You are Philip Stryver, executive vice-president of Daggett \"\r\r\n963,STRYVER,\"Call Bane! I'm one of you! Jeers. Pull back to reveal a silent figure, watching. Bane.  \"\r\r\n964,CRANE,\"Bane has no authority here. This is merely a sentencing hearing. The choice is yours, death or exile. Stryver looks around, terrified, as the crowd shouts 'Death'.    \"\r\r\n965,STRYVER,Exile.  \r\r\n966,CRANE, \r\r\n967,BLACKGATE INMATE,Follow the tick ice. Try to swim - you're dead in minutes.  \r\r\n968,STRYVER,\"Has anyone made it? The Blackgate Inmate turns away. Stryver is forced onto the ice. He shuffles forward, listening to the creaking... Stryver is a hundred yards out when the river swallows him.      \"\r\r\n969,GORDON,\"Where the hell are they? It's not like we have a lot of time, here.  \"\r\r\n970,COP,How long?  \r\r\n971,GORDON,The bomb goes off tomorrow. We've got about eighteen hours to do something.    \r\r\n972,COP,To do what?  \r\r\n973,GORDON,\"We mark that truck. Get a GPS on it, then we can start thinking about how to take it down. The door opens and Blake enters, followed by ten cops. Gordon is counting them in. He moves to Blake.    \"\r\r\n974,GORDON, \r\r\n975,GORDON,\"Foley. Where's Foley, dammit?! Gordon heads for the door.    \"\r\r\n976,BLAKE,You shouldn't be out on the streets  -      \r\r\n977,FOLEY'S WIFE,\"Jim. He's not here -   Gordon, furious, addresses the hallway behind her.  \"\r\r\n978,GORDON,You're sending your wife to the door when the city's under occupation?! Foley appears at the end of the corridor. Ashamed.  \r\r\n979,FOLEY,\"Wait in the kitchen, honey.    \"\r\r\n980,GORDON,\"What did you do, bury your uniform in the backyard?  \"\r\r\n981,FOLEY,\"Jim, you saw what they did to those Special Forces.  \"\r\r\n982,GORDON,You forgotten all the years we went out on patrol with every gangbanger wanting to plant one as soon as our backs were turned?  \r\r\n983,FOLEY,This is different and you know it. These guys run the city - the government's done a deal with them  -  \r\r\n984,GORDON,Deal?! Bane's got their balls in a vice. That's not a deal -  \r\r\n985,FOLEY,\"You move against Bane, the triggerman's gonna hit the button -  \"\r\r\n986,GORDON,You think he's given control of that bomb to one of 'the people'?! You think this is part of some revolution? There's one man with his finger on the button - Bane.  \r\r\n987,FOLEY,We have to keep our heads down until they can fix this. If you still had family here maybe you'd -    \r\r\n988,GORDON,This only gets fixed from inside \r\r\n989,FOLEY,I'm sorry Jim. I gotta -  \r\r\n990,GORDON,\"Keep your head down? What's that gonna do tomorrow, when that thing blows?  \"\r\r\n991,FOLEY,You don't know that's going to happen. Foley closes the door on Gordon. Gordon stands there.  \r\r\n992,MIRANDA,\"I hear you're looking for men, Commissioner. Gordon turns to see Miranda, Blake behind her. Blake shrugs.  \"\r\r\n993,MIRANDA,\"How about me, instead?  \"\r\r\n994,GORDON,\"Miss Tate, I can't ask you -  \"\r\r\n995,MIRANDA,My company built it.  \r\r\n996,GORDON,Bruce Wayne built it.  \r\r\n997,MIRANDA,And he wanted to destroy it. It was me who didn't listen. Please. Gordon looks at Blake. Then Miranda. Nods.  \r\r\n998,GORDON,Let's go.  \r\r\n999,GANGBANGER,\"You steal from us, you little bastard? They grab the Kid's backpack, the Gangbanger pulls out an apple, moves to hit the Kid when - SMACK! - his hand is grabbed, and the apple flies into the air as his arm cracks. Selina catches the apple.    \"\r\r\n1000,SELINA,\"You boys know you can't come into my neighborhood without asking politely.   Gangbanger 2 lunges with a knife - she spins him, making him stab himself in the backside. The Gangbangers run off, howling. The Kid eyes her, wary.  \"\r\r\n1001,SELINA,\"Never steal anything from someone you can't outrun, kid.  \"\r\r\n1002,KID,Now you're gonna take it.   Selina looks at the red apple. Takes one perfect bite.  \r\r\n1003,SELINA,Just tax. She tosses him the apple. He takes it and runs.  \r\r\n1004,WAYNE,\"Pretty generous, for a thief. Selina recognizes the voice. Turns to find Wayne - strong, but weathered. Beard, work clothes.  \"\r\r\n1005,SELINA,You came back. I thought they'd killed you.  \r\r\n1006,WAYNE,Not yet.  \r\r\n1007,SELINA,If you're expecting an apology -  \r\r\n1008,WAYNE,It wouldn't suit you. I need your help.  \r\r\n1009,SELINA,And why would I help you?   Wayne pulls a USB drive out of his pocket.  \r\r\n1010,WAYNE,For this. The 'Clean Slate'.  \r\r\n1011,SELINA,You're gonna trust me with that? After what I did to you?  \r\r\n1012,WAYNE,\"I admit I felt a little let down. But I still think there's more to you. In fact, I think for you - \"\r\r\n1013,SELINA,Start fresh? I can't even get off this island.  \r\r\n1014,WAYNE,I can give you a way off. Once you've gotten me to Lucius Fox. I need you to find out where they're holding him. Then take me in.    \r\r\n1015,SELINA,Why do you need Fox?  \r\r\n1016,WAYNE,To save this city.  \r\r\n1017,SELINA,Who says it needs saving? Maybe I like it this way.  \r\r\n1018,WAYNE,Maybe you do. But tomorrow that bomb's going off.  \r\r\n1019,SELINA,Get your powerful friend on the case.    \r\r\n1020,WAYNE,I'm trying. But I need Fox.  Gordon and his Men are in two-man teams. Gordon is walking down the street with Miranda. He hands her a Geiger counter.  \r\r\n1021,GORDON,\r\r\n1022,BLAKE, \r\r\n1023,GORDON,\"Got it.   They keep moving, turning down the next street...into an ambush. Dozens of Mercenaries, weapons trained.  \"\r\r\n1024,MERCENARY,\"Commissioner Gordon, you're under arrest.  \"\r\r\n1025,GORDON,On whose authority?  \r\r\n1026,MERCERNARY,\"The people of Gotham.   Blake, from his vantage point, watches Gordon, Miranda and the other Cops being rounded up and led away...    \"\r\r\n1027,MIRANDA,Bruce?    \r\r\n1028,FOX,\"You picked a hell of a time to go on vacation, Mr. Wayne.  \"\r\r\n1029,WAYNE,How long until the core ignites?    \r\r\n1030,FOX,That bomb goes off in twelve hours.  \r\r\n1031,WAYNE,Unless we can connect it to the reactor.  \r\r\n1032,FOX,If you can get it there. I'll find a way to plug it back in. \r\r\n1033,WAYNE,Not tonight. I'm sorry.  \r\r\n1034,MIRANDA,Do what's necessary.    \r\r\n1035,WAYNE, \r\r\n1036,FOX,What for?  \r\r\n1037,WAYNE,To get me back in the game. Catwoman comes down the stairs with the Thugs.    \r\r\n1038,CATWOMAN,\"Sorry to spoil things, boys, but Bane wants these guys himself... The thugs pull Wayne and Fox to their feet - Miranda looks up.  \"\r\r\n1039,WAYNE,I won't forget about you.  \r\r\n1040,MIRANDA,I know.    \r\r\n1041,FOX,\"I like your girlfriend, Mr. Wayne.    \"\r\r\n1042,CATWOMAN,He should be so lucky. And she's gone. Fox turns to Wayne. Who shrugs.      \r\r\n1043,WAYNE,Any move I make against Bane or the bomb - the triggerman sets it off.  \r\r\n1044,FOX,\"They can't be using radio or cell - too much interference. Infrared doesn't have the range. It could only be micro-burst long wave... Wayne opens a panel in the wall, takes out equipment: mini-mines, Batarangs, utility belt...  \"\r\r\n1045,WAYNE,Could you block it?  \r\r\n1046,FOX,Yes. I need the EMP cannon-guidance mount from the Bat. You remember where you parked? Wayne nods. Smiles. The Batsuit rises from the floor...  \r\r\n1047,CRANE,The charges are espionage and attempted sabotage... Do you have anything to say in your defense?  \r\r\n1048,GORDON,\"No lawyer, no witnesses. What sort of due process is this?  \"\r\r\n1049,CRANE,\"More than you give Harvey's prisoners, Commissioner. Your guilt is determined, this is merely a sentencing hearing. What's it to be, death or exile?  \"\r\r\n1050,GORDON,\"Crane, if you think we are going willingly out onto that ice, you've got another think coming.  \"\r\r\n1051,CRANE,\"Death, then?  \"\r\r\n1052,GORDON,Looks that way.  \r\r\n1053,CRANE,\r\r\n1054,BANE,Bring her to me.    \r\r\n1055,LUCIUS,I think it's time to talk about my year-end bonus...      \r\r\n1056,FOX,She fly pretty well?  \r\r\n1057,WAYNE,Even without the autopilot...  \r\r\n1058,FOX,Autopilot? That's what you're there for.    \r\r\n1059,BATMAN,\"Light it up.  Gordon, energized by the familiar voice, lights the flare - jams it into the liquid, sending a trail of FIRE across the ice - up into a building where it forms the shape of a  BAT...      \"\r\r\n1060,FOLEY'S KIDS,Dad! Check it out!    \r\r\n1061,FOLEY'S WIFE,\"Honey, take a look! Foley moves to a back window. Sees the flaming sign.      \"\r\r\n1062,MERCENARY,Sir?   Bane turns. The Mercenary points at the sign.  \r\r\n1063,MERCENARY,You think it's really him?    \r\r\n1064,BANE,Impossible...    \r\r\n1065,BATMAN,This blocks the remote detonator signal to the bomb. Get it onto the truck by sunrise. They might hit the button when it starts.    \r\r\n1066,GORDON,When what starts?  \r\r\n1067,BATMAN,War.      \r\r\n1068,BLAKE,You missed a spot. Batman boots him in the head as he moves towards Blake.    \r\r\n1069,BATMAN,\"If you're working alone, wear a mask.  \"\r\r\n1070,BLAKE,No one cares who I am.  \r\r\n1071,BATMAN,The mask is not for you. It's to protect the people you care about.    \r\r\n1072,BLAKE,Huh. And you always seem to know where those people are. How is that?  \r\r\n1073,BATMAN,I lost someone once. Since then I break into their homes when they're sleeping and implant a tracking device on the back of their neck.   Blake laughs. Then feels the back of his neck. Batman tosses Blake a mini-mine.  \r\r\n1074,BATMAN,\"On three - one, two, three - They throw the mini-mines at the rubble of the entrance - the blasts barely move any rubble.    \"\r\r\n1075,BLAKE,\"No offense, but you got anything bigger in that belt?  \"\r\r\n1076,BATMAN,That's to warn the men on the other side. Batman disappears into the shadows.  \r\r\n1077,BLAKE,But how do we -? KAABOOOM! The Bat's cannons light up the night.  \r\r\n1078,BLAKE,\"Okay.   Cops climb out into the cold night - skinny, ragged, but glad to be alive and carrying guns...  \"\r\r\n1079,BLAKE,What now?    \r\r\n1080,BATMAN,All-out assault on Bane...but you need to get the people you care about across the bridge.    \r\r\n1081,BLAKE,Why?  \r\r\n1082,BATMAN,In case we fail. Lead an exodus across the bridge. Save as many lives as you can.  \r\r\n1083,BLAKE,Don't you need me here?    \r\r\n1084,BATMAN,You've given me an army. Now go. Blake nods. Turns to leave. Stops.  \r\r\n1085,BLAKE,Thank you.    \r\r\n1086,BATMAN,Don't thank me yet.  \r\r\n1087,BLAKE,I might not get a chance later.   Batman nods. Blake disappears into the night.    \r\r\n1088,CATWOMAN,\"Oh, you shouldn't have... She hops on, feeling the controls.    \"\r\r\n1089,BATMAN,\"The mid-town tunnel's blocked by debris, but the cannons give you enough firepower to make a path for people.   Catwoman marvels at the controls...  \"\r\r\n1090,BATMAN,\"To start it, you -    VARROOOM!  \"\r\r\n1091,CATWOMAN,I got it.    \r\r\n1092,BATMAN,We've got forty-five minutes to save this city -  \r\r\n1093,CATWOMAN,\"No, I've got forty-five minutes to get clear of the blast radius, because you don't stand a chance against these guys.  \"\r\r\n1094,BATMAN,With your help I might.   She shakes her head.  \r\r\n1095,CATWOMAN,\"I'll open that tunnel, then I'm gone.   He looks at her.  \"\r\r\n1096,BATMAN,There's more to you than that. She stares back at him. Facade slipping a touch.    \r\r\n1097,CATWOMAN,\"Sorry to keep letting you down. He says nothing. She looks at him, imploring. Come with me. Save yourself. You don't owe these people anymore - you've given them everything...  \"\r\r\n1098,BATMAN,Not everything. Not yet.   Batman turns. Catwoman watches him go. Then fires up the bike and takes off.    \r\r\n1099,FOLEY,There's only one police in this city. He steps forward. The line follows.      \r\r\n1100,BANE,Open fire.    \r\r\n1101,GORDON,\"Come on, come on...    \"\r\r\n1102,BANE,You came back. To die with your city.  \r\r\n1103,BATMAN,\"No. I came back to stop you.  145.     Bane leaps at Batman, smashing powerful blows into his head. Batman ducks, weaves and smashes his fists into Bane's side. Someone is watching from the window of City Hall - Miranda.      \"\r\r\n1104,GORDON,That's impossible... Come on! Cut over to Fifth!   They sprint for the next parallel avenue...    \r\r\n1105,BLAKE,\"Knock on doors, spread the word - the bomb's going to blow! Get out by the South Street tunnel, or over the bridge! Do two blocks, then get back to the bus! The boys race down the street. Father Reilly climbs into the bus.      \"\r\r\n1106,BANE,\"Stay back. He is mine - Bane SMASHES Batman's head - moves in for the kill, but Batman SMASHES Bane to the ground, RIPS sideways across the tubes of Bane's mask with the blades of his forearm. Bane bellows, thrashing in AGONY. Batman holds him down with a hand on his throat - searches him with his free hand.  \"\r\r\n1107,BATMAN,Give me the trigger! You'd never give it to an ordinary citizen - Bane's thrashing calms as he stares at Batman through pain-soaked eyes...gasping through his broken mask for relief.    \r\r\n1108,BANE,I broke you. How have you come back?  \r\r\n1109,BATMAN,\"You thought you were the only one who could learn the strength to escape? Bane looks at Batman, curiosity behind his pain.    \"\r\r\n1110,BANE,I never escaped - R¯'s al Gh¯l  \r\r\n1111,A U,rescued me. That is why I must fulfill his plan. That is why I must avenge his murder.    \r\r\n1112,BATMAN, \r\r\n1113,A U, CLIMB -  \r\r\n1114,A,Gh¯l...  \r\r\n1115,U,\"Batman flinches, frozen as Miranda leans into his ear...   \"\r\r\n1116,MIRANDA,\"I am. Miranda has a knife through Batman's suit, into his ribs... And though I am not 'ordinary', I am a citizen...   She pulls out the trigger...    \"\r\r\n1117,MIRANDA/TALIA,My mother named me Talia before she was killed. The way I would've been killed if not for my protector...Bane.   \r\r\n1118,BANE,Goodbye. Then is overrun.  \r\r\n1119,TALIA,I climbed out of the pit... \r\r\n1120,A U,\"stop. R¯'s al Gh¯l has found Bane, bandaged.  \"\r\r\n1121,A U,   \r\r\n1122,TALIA,The League took us in. Trained us...      \r\r\n1123,TALIA,But my father could not accept Bane. R¯'s al Gh¯l watches Bane training. Turns away.  \r\r\n1124,A U,     \r\r\n1125,TALIA,\"He saw only a monster who could never be tamed. Whose very existence was a reminder of the hell he'd left his wife to die in. He excommunicated Bane from the League of Shadows. His only crime was that he loved me. I could not truly forgive my father... Talia looks at Batman, cold. Until you murdered him.    \"\r\r\n1126,BATMAN,He was trying to kill millions of innocent people -  \r\r\n1127,TALIA,\"'Innocent' is a strong word to throw around Gotham, Bruce. I honor my father by finishing his work. Vengeance against the man who killed him is simply a reward for my patience...   Talia twists the knife in Batman's side. You see, it's the slow knife...the knife that takes its time, the  \"\r\r\n1128,TALIA,\"knife that waits years without forgetting, then slips quietly between bones...that's the knife - Talia arms the trigger... - that cuts deepest. She hits the button - nothing.      \"\r\r\n1129,BATMAN,Your knife may have been too slow... A Mercenary steps forward -  \r\r\n1130,MERCENARY,\"The truck's under attack - Talia looks around, mind racing.  \"\r\r\n1131,TALIA,\r\r\n1132,TALIA,Not yet... I want him to feel the \r\r\n1133,BANE,\"You'll have to imagine the fire -   He shuts the gun - jams it into Batman's face. We both know I need to kill you now. He squeezes the trigger. BLAMMM! Bane is blasted across the lobby by cannon fire. Catwoman is there, on the Bat-Pod.  \"\r\r\n1134,CATWOMAN,The whole no-guns thing? I don't feel as strongly about it as you do.    \r\r\n1135,UNIFORM,Stay there! What are you doing?!  \r\r\n1136,BLAKE, \r\r\n1137,UNIFORM,Safety?! You're gonna get us all killed. Anyone crosses this bridge they blow the city -  \r\r\n1138,BLAKE,It's gonna blow anyway. We need this bridge open right now.  \r\r\n1139,UNIFORM,No one leaves the island. Orders -  \r\r\n1140,BLAKE,Whose orders? Bane's?  \r\r\n1141,UNIFORM,Police Department's.  \r\r\n1142,BLAKE,Haven't you heard the shooting? The Batman's battling it out with Bane  -    \r\r\n1143,UNIFORM,\"The Batman's dead. Look, Officer -  \"\r\r\n1144,BLAKE,It's Detective -    \r\r\n1145,UNIFORM,\"Well, Detective, you take one more step, we have to shoot you. Two more steps, we have to blow the bridge.    \"\r\r\n1146,BLAKE,\r\r\n1147,BATMAN,\"I need you on the ground, me in the air, we have to force that convoy east, to the entrance to the  REACTOR -    \"\r\r\n1148,BLAKE,\"Your orders are out of date! The situation's changed! Listen, I'm a cop like you. And I'm walking out there. Please don't shoot me. Blake walks. Shots ring out at his feet. He keeps walking...      \"\r\r\n1149,UNIFORM,\r\r\n1150,UNIFORM,\"Get down! We're blowing the bridge! As Blake looks, disbelieving, the bridge in front of him blasts upwards in a massive fireball. Blake dives backwards.  \"\r\r\n1151,BLAKE,You idiots! You sons of bitches! You're killing us!!  \r\r\n1152,BLAKE,Father! Get the boys on the bus -    \r\r\n1153,FATHER REILLY,\"But there's nowhere to go, son.   \"\r\r\n1154,TUMBLER DRIVER, \r\r\n1155,TALIA,Pushing us to the entrance of the reactor. They're going to try and reconnect the core.  \r\r\n1156,TUMBLER DRIVER, \r\r\n1157,GORDON,\"Give me a hand! The Bat lands at the tunnel mouth. Gordon moves in to try and grab the core but it is too hot. Let's get a cable on it and drag it out! Come on, we're almost there - Laughter. Gordon turns. Talia, lying half out the truck. Dying.  \"\r\r\n1158,TALIA,Fox showed me how to operate the reactor core. Including the emergency flood -    \r\r\n1159,TALIA,There is no way to stop this bomb. \r\r\n1160,GORDON,What're you doing?  \r\r\n1161,BATMAN,Two minutes. I can fly it out over the bay...   Catwoman is at his side as he works.  \r\r\n1162,CATWOMAN,\"Rig it out to fly over the water, then bail -  156.      \"\r\r\n1163,BATMAN,No autopilot. She takes this in. He stands to face her.  \r\r\n1164,CATWOMAN,You could've gone anywhere. Been anything. But you came back here.  \r\r\n1165,BATMAN,So did you.    \r\r\n1166,CATWOMAN,\"I guess we're both suckers. She puts her arms around his neck. Kisses him. Batman moves to the Bat, Gordon alongside.    \"\r\r\n1167,GORDON,\"So this is the part where you vanish, only this time you don't come back?   Batman opens the canopy.    \"\r\r\n1168,BLAKE,Come on! On the bus!  \r\r\n1169,FATHER REILLY,What're you doing?    \r\r\n1170,BLAKE,Protection from the blast -  \r\r\n1171,FATHER REILLY,\"It's an atom bomb -!   Blake turns on Father Reilly, furious.  \"\r\r\n1172,BLAKE,You think they need to hear that in their last seconds? You think I'm going to let them die without hope?  \r\r\n1173,GORDON,I never cared who you were -    \r\r\n1174,BATMAN,And you were right.  \r\r\n1175,GORDON,But shouldn't the people know the hero who saved them?  \r\r\n1176,BATMAN,\"A hero can be anyone. That was always the point.   Batman sits into the cockpit, then looks again at Gordon. Anyone. A man doing something as simple and reassuring as putting a coat around a little boy's shoulders to let him know that the world hadn't ended... The canopy closes - and as the Bat fires up Gordon remembers  - \"\r\r\n1177,GORDON,Bruce Wayne? - but is dusted by downdraft as the Bat RISES. Gordon LEAPS out of the way as the core is dragged along and out of the tunnel mouth.   The Bat struggles with the weight of the smoking core... A building is in the way - Batman fights the controls but there's no power to get over it.      \r\r\n1178,BLAKE,\"Heads down! Heads down, now!   \"\r\r\n1179,FATHER REILLY,\"Blake, they need to make their peace. Blake turns to him, furious.    \"\r\r\n1180,BLAKE,\"They're children! They have no peace to make - An EXPLOSION from downtown Gotham. Blake looks across, startled, turns to the children on the bus. Get down! This is it! The smallest of the boys stares through the window past Blake.    \"\r\r\n1181,LITTLE BOY,\"No. That's Batman! Blake turns to see the Bat thundering out of the heart of Gotham, trailing smoke, the core hanging from it. It curves dangerously close to the bridge before heading for the mouth of the river...the bay...the ocean... Until a point of light fires into an enormous nuclear BLAST - wind and light and dust blowing VIOLENTLY but harmlessly over the bridge, the tunnel mouth, all of Gotham...   As the nuclear dawn fades over Gotham, and we see its inhabitants start to raise their heads, and helicopters and boats converge on the island, we hear a voice. Jim Gordon.  \"\r\r\n1182,GORDON,'I see a beautiful city and a brilliant people rising from this abyss...' Blake pulls out his badge. Throws it into the river.    \r\r\n1183,GORDON,\"'I see the lives for which I lay down my life, peaceful, useful, prosperous and happy...'      \"\r\r\n1184,GORDON,\"'I see that I hold a sanctuary in their hearts, and in the hearts of their descendants, generations hence. It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done...' Gordon closes the book, looking down at Bruce Wayne's grave. 'It is a far, far better rest that I go to than I have ever known.'   Gordon looks up at the figure standing across from him... Alfred. Tears streaming. Fox places a gentle hand on Alfred's shoulder, then leaves. Gordon and Blake follow. Alfred, alone with the Wayne family, turns to the grave beside Bruce's - the grave of Thomas and Martha Wayne.  \"\r\r\n1185,ALFRED,\"I'm so sorry. I failed you. You trusted me, and I failed you. And the old man's shoulders begin to shake with sobs.    \"\r\r\n1186,GORDON,Can I change your mind about quitting the force?  \r\r\n1187,BLAKE,No. What you said about structures. About shackles. I can't take it. \r\r\n1188,GORDON,\r\r\n1189,LAWYER,\"Nonetheless, there are considerable assets to dispose of... The contents of the house are to be  SOLD - He glances up to see someone slip into the room - Blake.      \"\r\r\n1190,LAWYER,- to settle the estate's accounts. The remainder is left in its entirety to Alfred J. Pennyworth...      \r\r\n1191,LAWYER,\"The house and grounds are left to the city of Gotham, on condition that they never be demolished, altered, or otherwise interfered  WITH -  \"\r\r\n1192,LAWYER,\"And that they shall be used for one purpose, and one purpose only... A schoolbus pulls up. Father Reilly shepherds children towards the house. The children look up at the house, wide-eyed. The housing and care of the city's at-risk and orphaned children.  \"\r\r\n1193,LAWYER,My clerk will help anyone with the smaller correspondences and instructions...  \r\r\n1194,BLAKE,\"Blake, John.  \"\r\r\n1195,CLERK,Nothing here.  \r\r\n1196,BLAKE,Try my legal name.  \r\r\n1197,CLERK,\"Yup, here it is.  \"\r\r\n1198,CLERK,You should use your full name. I like that name... Robin.  \r\r\n1199,LAWYER,Any word on the missing item?  \r\r\n1200,CLERK,\"No, not yet.  \"\r\r\n1201,LAWYER,\"Well, they'd better leave no stone unturned... We can't just put a string of pearls on the manifest as 'lost'.   TECH 1 Why worry about the stabilization software? This whole autopilot system's obsolete -  \"\r\r\n1202,FOX,\"Please, I just need to know what I could've done to fix it.  TECH 2 But Mr. Fox, it's already been \"\r\r\n1203,FOX,Check the user ident on the patch...   TECH 2 Huh. Bruce Wayne.  \r\r\n1204,WAITER,Lei e solo?  \r\r\n
